Hands down it\\'s one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh\\'s performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something, her performance was actually good, but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour\\'s? He stole the show\\nHe\\'s the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I\\'d rate the movie 4/10\\nScarlett Johansson\\'s performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from \"Marriage Story\": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz\\'s performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I\\'d love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he\\'s a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females\\' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn\\'t enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it\\'s not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one.It\\'s an average Marvel movie, just don\\'t expect much, and you\\'d have fun.',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7100565/': \"Black widow had a very strong first half, then it completely derailed. The villain was barely in the movie and was a complete waste. As a female, I love black widow and was so excited for this film. Natasha has always been my favorite superhero, in the comics and in the MCU. I've seen every marvel movie in the cinemas and was literally bouncing off my seat waiting for it to start. Was also so thrilled for the movie to have a female director, finally! But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. The action scenes were way too forced and tremendously exaggerated, and on top of that the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling. The last act doesn't even feel like something a MCU movie would have, considering how popular and good other MCU movies were. This movie could have been so much better, like the insane opening sequence seemed to imply. However, I loved the comedic and the family moments in the film and those got some good reactions out of me.This movie does not feel like a final sendoff of Natasha Romanoff or even in close attempts to complete Romanoff's story arc. Florence Pugh and David Habour give stellar performances in this movie. After some time without Marvel movies, this movie is more of just an escapist popcorn fun and thats all. With all this in mind, the movie did atleast make me happy in wanting to watch more of Pugh's amazing future performances in the MCU. I am so excited to see Yelena in the future. Pugh definitely gained a fan. (:I hope everyone has a safe and fun experience with finally being able to go back to the cinemas.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7105070/': \"So... I watched the Black Widow last night... I am sorry to say, but I'm so disappointed... MCU really has a problem with female hero movies and this is their lowest point by far, which is a pity because both Scarlett Johansson and Natasha Romanoff deserved much much better.I really don't understand where the need for totally exegarated and over the top action scenes came from, Natasha Romanoff is more than capable, but she is only human and in the movie she could be Thor himself, no difference at all. The story could've been passable if not for terrible inconsistency and skipping-jumping all over the place. The beginning felt so very off, nothing about it felt warm and likable, the overly sciency explanation of the fireflies to the 5yo felt so out of place even later when we realized their true identities. The Red Room has been handled awfully. Natasha's backstory is really tragic and the Red Room's legend by itself provide so much potential for great storytelling, even if it is just something to speed over, but that part of the movie was just a mess of unrelated photos and sequences where you can't see which part is Natasha, which is Jelena, nor anything else except for bunch of supposedly targets I guess. These theme was so much better handled in Agent Carter even if there too it was just a few scenes to brush over, it still had so much more impact than what is done here, and this was supposed to be a movie about the most famous girl that came out of that place! And this is just the first 5 to 10 min of the movie, however the rest doesn't get much better, since it is terribly unbalanced mix of action scenes (with the girls being totally indestructible which really bothers me), comedy and tragedy backstory. And when I say terribly unbalanced, I mean it, one sec you are laughing at something Alexei did or said (which is problematic by itself) and the next you are abruptly interrupted because, you know - tragic backstory, how could Natasha ever laugh or be happy or whatever... I really hated that about the movie, the forced comedy, the forced tragedy, the forced action, everything is forced... And I am not even going to into details with the worst part of it - the villains! Aside from the main guy who was made throughout the movie like some all powerful monster - which he's not, he's a pathetic old man with a power fetish like most of them are, his main guy, the one who's supposed to be one of the toughest Marvel antagonists was reduced to unbelievable, pathetic backstory, diminished in everything that makes him a great character in comics and is used only as a device to drive the plot forward without anything to like, fear or admire. Such a dissapointment! So, in conclusion, this was a very bad movie I don't intend on watching again.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7112280/': \"The problem with the latest Marvel movies is that the studios want to get their hands on directors' visions and especially on the characters themselves, destroying content with very high potential, ridiculing it with squalid and out of place jokes, with characters reduced to the bone, introduced and never deepened. A colossal flaw of the latest Marvel films, like this one, is that despite the talent of the directors and the vision they have, there is always the production to dismantle everything, in fact you can already notice it from simple things like a plethora of cross-cutting, like when there is a fight (or something big in progress) and suddenly attention is diverted to another scene, thus throwing smoke in the viewer's eyes, because this specifically cross-cutting is for this purpose and not because it's needed. Another waste of potential by Marvel Studios, despite having fun, stellar cast, great vision, cinematography and some good amazing ideas, but we must admit that already the current Marvel TV Series are clearly superior in terms of themes, exploited potential and much more. Disappointing for what could have been, acceptable for what it is.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7118902/': \"This movie demonstrates everything that's wrong with big Hollywood blockbusters.Way too much CGI.Mediocre writing.Mediocre plot.Mostly below-par acting.Johansson spent the entire movie looking like she wanted to be somewhere else.Harbour was as bad in this as he was in Hellboy. The dude seriously needs to expand his emotional range.Weisz was dismal and totally unbelievable.Winstone was woefully underused, and so was William Hurt.Look, I don't expect Shakespearean performances from a Marvel movie. However, I do expect some level of competence.I will say, though, Pugh was outstandingly good. She came across as committed (unlike Johansson) and like she actually wanted to be in the movie (again, unlike Johansson).Most of the action was well done, too.Other than that, this movie wasn't good at all.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7102361/': 'I want to start by saying I\\'m not the sort of person who likes to ruin other people\\'s enjoyment of any piece of entertainment, but there were times watching this in the cinema where I either laughed at a scene that was supposed to be straight faced or rolled my eyes all the way to the back of my head. Please only read this review if you\\'ve actually seen the movie.One thing that REALLY annoys me about the dialogue in Marvel movies - sarcasm, why does everyone have to be so sarcastic? Sarcasm doesn\\'t work as levity when every single sentence has it, there\\'s no subtlety to it at all. Most egregious is when David Harbour\\'s character is escaping from his neo-industrial cyber prison whilst on comms with Black Widow and she tells him to not cause a scene...immediate cut to him causing a scene, yes that works that\\'s funny but the very next shot is Black Widow saying \"you caused a scene didn\\'t you?\" in the same tone one mentions spilled milk, completely ruining the gag.CGI, I have no problem with it, it lets films reach visual heights that were previously confined to the realms of dreams...so why use it for a shot of a car turning a corner on a mountain? Like I said I have no problem with CGI when used properly, but it seems to be used almost out of laziness here, towards the beginning there\\'s a shot of a plane landing in Cuba and it looks so unbelievably phoney I\\'m sure a 15 year old using After Effects could have produced a more striking result, it\\'s hard to immerse yourself in this cinematic world when even the most simple things look artificial, if one of those fancy futuristic VTOL jets looks artificial then you can absolutely suspend your disbelief but it simply doesn\\'t work on the same level for something that could easily be achieved without the use of computers.And the final thing that really annoyed me about the film (other than the John Lewis advert Nirvana opening theme), it holds your hand throughout the whole narrative, not letting the audience work things out themselves. Major spoiler territory here you\\'ve been warned. When Rachel Weisz\\'s character tells Black Widow that the \"Red Room\" have been alerted it should be obvious that she\\'s doing it for Black Widow\\'s benefit, not because she\\'s a double agent, the next five minutes are spent with David Harbour trying to re-establish his \"fatherly\" bond with Florence Pugh, so it\\'s obvious that it\\'s all going to plan - there\\'s no fighting, no Black Widow telling everyone they have to get out of dodge, just that...so why did they include a flashback sequence that shows that it was intentional after we\\'ve already gone to the Red Room with them? We\\'ve already worked that out! The exact same crime is committed when Ray Winstone\\'s character explains that Black Widow cannot attack him as long as she can smell his pheromones, so naturally she makes him break her nose, cool. But then there\\'s ANOTHER flashback sequence where Rachel Weisz explains to the audience that Black Widow has to break her nose in order to attack him...WHY? Again, we\\'ve worked that out! It was pretty bloody obvious....anyway, enough ranting.David Harbour\\'s character is genuinely funny, good performances all round (except for Ray Winstone) and it\\'s definitely enjoyable enough to justify seeing, but you will be feeling like a pretentious cinema elitist every time you shake your head.',\n",

Or it's just me...?I watched black widow and like many reviewers here I share the same thoughts.This is a very average action flick that doesn't add anything important to the MCU.It's puzzling me because I know the producers are the same like before so they wouldn't allow flaws or mediocre results.But the CGI is weird in some shots and the story is weak.Let alone the boring lines, the unnecessary sarcasm and the lack of pace.I would ask, why is this film made?I find it unnecessary, even for the most dedicated fans of the MCU.I m kind of disappointed because it looks like Marvel's intentions are not based on quality anymore.So, if you watch this film, remember not to expect much and you ll save yourself from disappointment.5,5/10.\",\n",

I am so disappointed that Marvel could put this junk out, they really did not do justice to the Black Widow character. Just another over the top, overused CGI snorefest.The writers make Natasha into an indestructible human that could rival a super soldiers powers, yet she is just a human with bones that are apparently unbreakable?!?!? A helicopter falls from the sky and everyone just walks away. Also, The Red Guardian??? Huh? Locked away in a Russian prison and it seems even though he could have broken out any time he wanted he didn't.Nothing against Ray Winstone but he can't keep a Russian accent to save his life. His English accent destroys what could have been a decent scene. She cannot attack Draykov because the smell of his pheromones prevent her from hurting him? But by breaking her nose it unlocks the power to be able to defeat him. That was not too predictable at all and he never even saw it coming. (Insert sarcasm here)The only shining star is Florence Pugh's acting but that was not even close to saving this movie from a 2 star rating.This could have been such a good story/movie but as usual, lazy writing and a huge fan base will unfortunately make this movie a financial success which will encourage Marvel to produce more garbage that their fanboys will eat up and stand in line to give their money to these studios.

There's at least a half-dozen fights in this movie that make no sense at all, other than to pay for Heidi Moneymaker's second house. And they completely wasted Taskmaster in this.

I thought it would be horrible, stink to high heaven and I would be forced to write a review around 1/10.But it is not that bad, actually it is okay.The problem with \"okay\" is that it leaves you feel nothing, and this even if the main character was not already dead in the continuity of the MCU.The only interesting thing about this pointless endeavour is the post credit scene with Yelena. All the rest feel like okay action, with okay directing, within an okay (but weird) storyline. I could say that this movie is slightly better than okay (almost good) if it was not for three crucial facts. 1) Black widow is dead, so why would we care? And 2) the \"family\" drama and relationship feels very forced and weird since they barely seen each other and have no real relationship. And 3) Taskmaster is treated as horrible as possible in this movie. Absolutely atrociously done and yet another character from the comics is forever tainted.Florence Pugh is the star of the movie. She is just as excellent in this as she is in everything else she does. Great actress and if she is replacing Scarlet in the MCU that is a clear upgrade.Scarlet and Pugh in scenes together is mostly a plus, although I think it is a bit too much a times, especially when Scarlet tries to banter like she is Spiderman... Music score is pretty great, and CGi, as norm with Marvel. Is on very high standard. But everything else is just okay.I simply did not feel it. This move offered nothing, filled no void, and nothing interesting to say, and managed to destroy a villain character. Is it nice to look at and is the action good? Sure.. but why should we care?Black Widow has never been a A-list character, in fact her comics have never sold and she has always been a background boring addition to some teams. That they took her into the Avengers and MCU worked because of script, overarching story and the people around BW/scarlet. When BW/Scarlet need to be on her own, she is overshadow by her \"sister\", and we do not care because she is already a dead character. Scarlet is (just as her character) not a box office winner, she never was, and she never will be.Hard to grade this. I think anything from 4-7 of 10 is viable. I ended up giving it a 5/10.

I don't know what the heck happened here, how this got past quality control, but this is a proper stinker. The plot is a heap of nothing, anyone could've dashed it off in 15 minutes. The characters are completely flat, and just exist to serve up lukewarm banter.

The hero has to be able to show weakness or else the whole movie becomes make belief gibberish that would have satisfied moviegoers in the 90s or early 2000s but nowadays is easily identified as hollywood trash by the contemporary viewers.We know that people take damage, we know that after people are tossed from a building they would take at least half an hour to be able to walk straight. We know that explosions would burn the hell out of you and make you scream out in pain if you are too close to the source. These are all well known and established common sense expectations only distorted by mediocre movie makers of the past.Thankfully movies like John Wick, Nobody or any Tarantino movie shows how it is done right. The heroes may seem invincible but they take damage, they have to take a breath after fighting two guys at once, they bleed and stumble profusely due to the injuries, the explosions seems to hurt them substantially and maybe most importantly they also do get hurt. You can explain these realistic key aspects away by making the protagonist a super human soldier, or a god even, as marvel does but when a sole human is the hero you cannot and should not.Black widow hence becomes yet another cliche action flick where the hero gets to run a marathon after realistically having broken more than a few bones after a fight. I am sorry to say but that is action flick trash.',\n",

In the end, the movie just doesn't leave much of an impression and feels very by-the-numbers and lacks anything memorable about it at all. To me, it felt like a mediocre Spy/Bond film with Marvel paint added to it, and that's not a good thing for this franchise. I'd be surprised if I remember anything about this in a week's time, because right now this is my least favourite MCU movie.The fight sequences are passable but don't have much oomphh to them or stick in your head as interesting. The bad guys are kind of just there for most of it and by the end are just a little generic with the twists and turns it expects you to be surprised at. The family stuff is probably the best stuff but even then there's some odd attempts at humour that don't really work and it kind of can't make its mind up if it's deadly serious or not. Alot of flashbacks and strange editing choices too.In the end, this could have really been any Spy/Action film. Black Widow herself can't pull an entire movie by herself. Florence Pugh's character isn't much better and we also have essentially a Captain America ripoff person to try to add some dynamic and energy to it. There's just nothing here that kept me engaged or interested in how the story plays out. I was a bit bored, and I think I would pick Captain Marvel over this as at least that has Samuel L.

They just collect scraped pieces of previous unused scripts and put them together in a movie.And the jokes in this movie, holy cow, don't even get me started they ruin the emotional moments EVERY DAMN TIME. The climax exchange between Natasha and villain is laughable as hell.And Why does every end fight in superhero movie have to big explosion and stuff. Just bad script writing.Natasha deserved better.

Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things. Overall a great movie.\",\n",

Despite the interesting world building, this show suffers from the same problems that plagued the previous The Falcon show. A weak female lead in Lady Loki, who just doesn't hold a candle to Hiddleston in terms of charm and charisma. The TVA's power levels are wildly inconsistent or just plain poorly written. Sometimes they can beat and handle a God like they're children, but sometimes they seem like they wouldn't be able to stop a shoplifter. I enjoyed the finale only because of it's implications for the future of the MCU, not because it was well written or executed. I found it at times clumsy and overly ambitious, with arbitrary solutions to seemingly impossible problems. As much as I love the MCU, I wish they would cut down on the number of new shows, and focus on maintaining quality. Overall, they're still good, but they could be better.

It has rick & Morty writers on the board but all they did is a bunch of multiverse fanservice (say hi to Kid Loki, Old Loki, and move on). If you look at the whole picture it feels empty, lifeless, and meaningless. It's just bread and butter before the main dish.

But the negative reviews that WandaVision received should have told me that the world prefers beautiful crap more than it does unembellished gems. And that's what we got in the end in Loki - beautiful crap that is receiving great praise from fans who want blind entertainment and don't give a damn about storyline as long as the charm is there. I understand now why Hollywood is producing stupid movies like Fast and Furious more and more every year now. People are demanding it.Loki.. is a beautiful piece of.. nothing. Okay.. something. But only something.. because when you get plot-holes the size of a planet, how can you have anything of substance in the storyline? There is no character consistency, no plot consistency, no imagination (everyone looks like humans, every single being on any other planet looks exactly like humans and have very human like cultures. The entire TVA is filled with humans and the only non-human characters turn out to be robots in the end and the real villain turns out to be.. well.. a human..) but yes, something is there; and that something is - charisma.This is a show that is literally carried solely by Tom and his depiction of Loki. You take him out and replace him with anyone else and people would be giving it 3-5 stars at max because once again, apart from him, nothing of note is there. It's not like time travel can not be done in a well written manner; it has been done in hundreds of books and mangas and series and movies before but this one, nah. Since this series tries to merge time travel with multiverse, with supervillains, with gods, with friendship, with love, with humour, and with almost everything else sellable in the world, it forgets to focus and develop any one thing completely. And in the end, we get a mishmash of everything in small quantity and nothing in full. Great ride for those who like to drool over special effects and charisma, and a confused, nonsensical, unimaginative drivel for those who like to search for deeper congruence in their fiction. Full on entertainment with no logic behind it. This is Bollywood at its best. Ah.. I forgot.. it's Hollywood.. but it didn't feel like it.. except for the time when the special effects were used, it didn't feel like even once...I think - to each her own.\",\n",

I saw a couple of them but for the most part, to me they felt like homogeneous, fairly bland, and forgottable movies with no real artistic vision behind them - they felt more like well-crafted products than actual art (what a movie is normally supposed to be).I value movies such as Superman, Superman II: The Richard Donner's Cut, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, some of the X-Men movies and Shazam much more - the only real exception is Guardians of the Galaxy 2, which managed to evoke the same kind of magic that I felt while watching those other movies.Why I like these movies? Because they have heart - they touch me on a deep emotional level. Because these movies have a strong artistic vision and it shows. Because these are first and foremost character-driven movies that focus on the everyday struggles and problems of the characters and are just secondarily superhero movies.---And this is the reason why I love Loki too. It's a series that is part of the MCU, yet it feels like anything but a part of it. It feels like the very best that superhero stories can offer. It feels authentic, it feels genuine, it feels heavily artist-driven.Action generally takes a backseat and instead every single episode focuses on building characters, character relationships, and the strange world of the series itself which ultimately makes the series so much better than practically anything you can see in the MCU (although GotG2 is a brillant movie).The main trio of the characters are fantastically realized, loveable and relatable. There are a lot of wholesome, sweet, and truly human moments in the show that remind me of the old Superman movies and the Raimi Spider-Man movies that I mentioned previously.The show also has a great amount of intellectual depth, not just compared to other MCU stories, but in general too (especially in the earlier episodes), exploring interesting concepts such as the existence of free will or pre-determination in a visual way and through cleverly written dialogues.Both the emotional and intellectual scenes serve to build the characters and what is fantastic is that these moments play out effortlessly and naturally, in a very believable manner. The cameran doesn't cut away, the creators are not afraid to make things slower.They smartly let these scenes fully play out, this way making it possible for viewers to fully soak in the moment and for the actors to fully embrace their characters and get the most out of these scenes. This is when this series shines the best and I've only really seen scenes like this in independent, heavily artist-driven, lower-budget movies.On the top of these, the story, the pacing and the overall thematical and logical consistency of the series are also excellent. The story is constantly moving forward without any padding or filler, in fact, so many meaningful things happen in the span of a couple of episodes that it would have taken multiple seasons for other TV shows to tell the same story.Loki is a modern gem that perfectly captures the magic of the greatest superhero movies. I can't recommend it enough.\"}"

Hands down it\\'s one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh\\'s performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something, her performance was actually good, but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour\\'s? He stole the show\\nHe\\'s the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I\\'d rate the movie 4/10\\nScarlett Johansson\\'s performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from \"Marriage Story\": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz\\'s performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I\\'d love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he\\'s a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females\\' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn\\'t enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it\\'s not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one.It\\'s an average Marvel movie, just don\\'t expect much, and you\\'d have fun.',\n",
       " \"Black widow had a very strong first half, then it completely derailed. The villain was barely in the movie and was a complete waste. As a female, I love black widow and was so excited for this film. Natasha has always been my favorite superhero, in the comics and in the MCU. I've seen every marvel movie in the cinemas and was literally bouncing off my seat waiting for it to start. Was also so thrilled for the movie to have a female director, finally! But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. The action scenes were way too forced and tremendously exaggerated, and on top of that the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling. The last act doesn't even feel like something a MCU movie would have, considering how popular and good other MCU movies were. This movie could have been so much better, like the insane opening sequence seemed to imply. However, I loved the comedic and the family moments in the film and those got some good reactions out of me.This movie does not feel like a final sendoff of Natasha Romanoff or even in close attempts to complete Romanoff's story arc. Florence Pugh and David Habour give stellar performances in this movie. After some time without Marvel movies, this movie is more of just an escapist popcorn fun and thats all. With all this in mind, the movie did atleast make me happy in wanting to watch more of Pugh's amazing future performances in the MCU. I am so excited to see Yelena in the future. Pugh definitely gained a fan. (:I hope everyone has a safe and fun experience with finally being able to go back to the cinemas.\",\n",
       " \"So... I watched the Black Widow last night... I am sorry to say, but I'm so disappointed... MCU really has a problem with female hero movies and this is their lowest point by far, which is a pity because both Scarlett Johansson and Natasha Romanoff deserved much much better.I really don't understand where the need for totally exegarated and over the top action scenes came from, Natasha Romanoff is more than capable, but she is only human and in the movie she could be Thor himself, no difference at all. The story could've been passable if not for terrible inconsistency and skipping-jumping all over the place. The beginning felt so very off, nothing about it felt warm and likable, the overly sciency explanation of the fireflies to the 5yo felt so out of place even later when we realized their true identities. The Red Room has been handled awfully. Natasha's backstory is really tragic and the Red Room's legend by itself provide so much potential for great storytelling, even if it is just something to speed over, but that part of the movie was just a mess of unrelated photos and sequences where you can't see which part is Natasha, which is Jelena, nor anything else except for bunch of supposedly targets I guess. These theme was so much better handled in Agent Carter even if there too it was just a few scenes to brush over, it still had so much more impact than what is done here, and this was supposed to be a movie about the most famous girl that came out of that place! And this is just the first 5 to 10 min of the movie, however the rest doesn't get much better, since it is terribly unbalanced mix of action scenes (with the girls being totally indestructible which really bothers me), comedy and tragedy backstory. And when I say terribly unbalanced, I mean it, one sec you are laughing at something Alexei did or said (which is problematic by itself) and the next you are abruptly interrupted because, you know - tragic backstory, how could Natasha ever laugh or be happy or whatever... I really hated that about the movie, the forced comedy, the forced tragedy, the forced action, everything is forced... And I am not even going to into details with the worst part of it - the villains! Aside from the main guy who was made throughout the movie like some all powerful monster - which he's not, he's a pathetic old man with a power fetish like most of them are, his main guy, the one who's supposed to be one of the toughest Marvel antagonists was reduced to unbelievable, pathetic backstory, diminished in everything that makes him a great character in comics and is used only as a device to drive the plot forward without anything to like, fear or admire. Such a dissapointment! So, in conclusion, this was a very bad movie I don't intend on watching again.\",\n",
       " \"The problem with the latest Marvel movies is that the studios want to get their hands on directors' visions and especially on the characters themselves, destroying content with very high potential, ridiculing it with squalid and out of place jokes, with characters reduced to the bone, introduced and never deepened. A colossal flaw of the latest Marvel films, like this one, is that despite the talent of the directors and the vision they have, there is always the production to dismantle everything, in fact you can already notice it from simple things like a plethora of cross-cutting, like when there is a fight (or something big in progress) and suddenly attention is diverted to another scene, thus throwing smoke in the viewer's eyes, because this specifically cross-cutting is for this purpose and not because it's needed. Another waste of potential by Marvel Studios, despite having fun, stellar cast, great vision, cinematography and some good amazing ideas, but we must admit that already the current Marvel TV Series are clearly superior in terms of themes, exploited potential and much more. Disappointing for what could have been, acceptable for what it is.\",\n",

The dude seriously needs to expand his emotional range.Weisz was dismal and totally unbelievable.Winstone was woefully underused, and so was William Hurt.Look, I don't expect Shakespearean performances from a Marvel movie. However, I do expect some level of competence.I will say, though, Pugh was outstandingly good.

       " 'I want to start by saying I\\'m not the sort of person who likes to ruin other people\\'s enjoyment of any piece of entertainment, but there were times watching this in the cinema where I either laughed at a scene that was supposed to be straight faced or rolled my eyes all the way to the back of my head. Please only read this review if you\\'ve actually seen the movie.One thing that REALLY annoys me about the dialogue in Marvel movies - sarcasm, why does everyone have to be so sarcastic? Sarcasm doesn\\'t work as levity when every single sentence has it, there\\'s no subtlety to it at all. Most egregious is when David Harbour\\'s character is escaping from his neo-industrial cyber prison whilst on comms with Black Widow and she tells him to not cause a scene...immediate cut to him causing a scene, yes that works that\\'s funny but the very next shot is Black Widow saying \"you caused a scene didn\\'t you?\" in the same tone one mentions spilled milk, completely ruining the gag.CGI, I have no problem with it, it lets films reach visual heights that were previously confined to the realms of dreams...so why use it for a shot of a car turning a corner on a mountain? Like I said I have no problem with CGI when used properly, but it seems to be used almost out of laziness here, towards the beginning there\\'s a shot of a plane landing in Cuba and it looks so unbelievably phoney I\\'m sure a 15 year old using After Effects could have produced a more striking result, it\\'s hard to immerse yourself in this cinematic world when even the most simple things look artificial, if one of those fancy futuristic VTOL jets looks artificial then you can absolutely suspend your disbelief but it simply doesn\\'t work on the same level for something that could easily be achieved without the use of computers.And the final thing that really annoyed me about the film (other than the John Lewis advert Nirvana opening theme), it holds your hand throughout the whole narrative, not letting the audience work things out themselves. Major spoiler territory here you\\'ve been warned. When Rachel Weisz\\'s character tells Black Widow that the \"Red Room\" have been alerted it should be obvious that she\\'s doing it for Black Widow\\'s benefit, not because she\\'s a double agent, the next five minutes are spent with David Harbour trying to re-establish his \"fatherly\" bond with Florence Pugh, so it\\'s obvious that it\\'s all going to plan - there\\'s no fighting, no Black Widow telling everyone they have to get out of dodge, just that...so why did they include a flashback sequence that shows that it was intentional after we\\'ve already gone to the Red Room with them? We\\'ve already worked that out! The exact same crime is committed when Ray Winstone\\'s character explains that Black Widow cannot attack him as long as she can smell his pheromones, so naturally she makes him break her nose, cool. But then there\\'s ANOTHER flashback sequence where Rachel Weisz explains to the audience that Black Widow has to break her nose in order to attack him...WHY? Again, we\\'ve worked that out! It was pretty bloody obvious....anyway, enough ranting.David Harbour\\'s character is genuinely funny, good performances all round (except for Ray Winstone) and it\\'s definitely enjoyable enough to justify seeing, but you will be feeling like a pretentious cinema elitist every time you shake your head.',\n",

Just another over the top, overused CGI snorefest.The writers make Natasha into an indestructible human that could rival a super soldiers powers, yet she is just a human with bones that are apparently unbreakable?!?!? A helicopter falls from the sky and everyone just walks away. Also, The Red Guardian??? Huh? Locked away in a Russian prison and it seems even though he could have broken out any time he wanted he didn't.Nothing against Ray Winstone but he can't keep a Russian accent to save his life. His English accent destroys what could have been a decent scene. She cannot attack Draykov because the smell of his pheromones prevent her from hurting him? But by breaking her nose it unlocks the power to be able to defeat him. That was not too predictable at all and he never even saw it coming. (Insert sarcasm here)The only shining star is Florence Pugh's acting but that was not even close to saving this movie from a 2 star rating.This could have been such a good story/movie but as usual, lazy writing and a huge fan base will unfortunately make this movie a financial success which will encourage Marvel to produce more garbage that their fanboys will eat up and stand in line to give their money to these studios.

There's at least a half-dozen fights in this movie that make no sense at all, other than to pay for Heidi Moneymaker's second house. And they completely wasted Taskmaster in this.

All the rest feel like okay action, with okay directing, within an okay (but weird) storyline. I could say that this movie is slightly better than okay (almost good) if it was not for three crucial facts. 1) Black widow is dead, so why would we care? And 2) the \"family\" drama and relationship feels very forced and weird since they barely seen each other and have no real relationship. And 3) Taskmaster is treated as horrible as possible in this movie. Absolutely atrociously done and yet another character from the comics is forever tainted.Florence Pugh is the star of the movie. She is just as excellent in this as she is in everything else she does. Great actress and if she is replacing Scarlet in the MCU that is a clear upgrade.Scarlet and Pugh in scenes together is mostly a plus, although I think it is a bit too much a times, especially when Scarlet tries to banter like she is Spiderman... Music score is pretty great, and CGi, as norm with Marvel. Is on very high standard. But everything else is just okay.I simply did not feel it. This move offered nothing, filled no void, and nothing interesting to say, and managed to destroy a villain character. Is it nice to look at and is the action good? Sure.. but why should we care?Black Widow has never been a A-list character, in fact her comics have never sold and she has always been a background boring addition to some teams. That they took her into the Avengers and MCU worked because of script, overarching story and the people around BW/scarlet. When BW/Scarlet need to be on her own, she is overshadow by her \"sister\", and we do not care because she is already a dead character. Scarlet is (just as her character) not a box office winner, she never was, and she never will be.Hard to grade this. I think anything from 4-7 of 10 is viable. I ended up giving it a 5/10.

I don't know what the heck happened here, how this got past quality control, but this is a proper stinker. The plot is a heap of nothing, anyone could've dashed it off in 15 minutes.

The hero has to be able to show weakness or else the whole movie becomes make belief gibberish that would have satisfied moviegoers in the 90s or early 2000s but nowadays is easily identified as hollywood trash by the contemporary viewers.We know that people take damage, we know that after people are tossed from a building they would take at least half an hour to be able to walk straight. We know that explosions would burn the hell out of you and make you scream out in pain if you are too close to the source. These are all well known and established common sense expectations only distorted by mediocre movie makers of the past.Thankfully movies like John Wick, Nobody or any Tarantino movie shows how it is done right. The heroes may seem invincible but they take damage, they have to take a breath after fighting two guys at once, they bleed and stumble profusely due to the injuries, the explosions seems to hurt them substantially and maybe most importantly they also do get hurt. You can explain these realistic key aspects away by making the protagonist a super human soldier, or a god even, as marvel does but when a sole human is the hero you cannot and should not.Black widow hence becomes yet another cliche action flick where the hero gets to run a marathon after realistically having broken more than a few bones after a fight.

I'd be surprised if I remember anything about this in a week's time, because right now this is my least favourite MCU movie.The fight sequences are passable but don't have much oomphh to them or stick in your head as interesting. The bad guys are kind of just there for most of it and by the end are just a little generic with the twists and turns it expects you to be surprised at. The family stuff is probably the best stuff but even then there's some odd attempts at humour that don't really work and it kind of can't make its mind up if it's deadly serious or not. Alot of flashbacks and strange editing choices too.In the end, this could have really been any Spy/Action film. Black Widow herself can't pull an entire movie by herself. Florence Pugh's character isn't much better and we also have essentially a Captain America ripoff person to try to add some dynamic and energy to it.

Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense.

He's such a great actor and does his best work as Loki. Also, this is one of the best performances of Owen Wilson's career, he is just fantastic in it! I really can not recommend this incredible series enough!\",\n",
       " 'After Wandavision I had high hopes for Loki, but this is just non-stop exposition.In 2 hours Back to the Future had told an entire time travel story. Two episodes into this and nothing has happened. Unless you really like watching Loki do office admin.',\n",
       " \"I was hyped to see this one after the fresh surprise that was WandaVision. But the negative reviews that WandaVision received should have told me that the world prefers beautiful crap more than it does unembellished gems. And that's what we got in the end in Loki - beautiful crap that is receiving great praise from fans who want blind entertainment and don't give a damn about storyline as long as the charm is there. I understand now why Hollywood is producing stupid movies like Fast and Furious more and more every year now. People are demanding it.Loki.. is a beautiful piece of.. nothing. Okay.. something. But only something.. because when you get plot-holes the size of a planet, how can you have anything of substance in the storyline? There is no character consistency, no plot consistency, no imagination (everyone looks like humans, every single being on any other planet looks exactly like humans and have very human like cultures. The entire TVA is filled with humans and the only non-human characters turn out to be robots in the end and the real villain turns out to be.. well.. a human..) but yes, something is there; and that something is - charisma.This is a show that is literally carried solely by Tom and his depiction of Loki. You take him out and replace him with anyone else and people would be giving it 3-5 stars at max because once again, apart from him, nothing of note is there. It's not like time travel can not be done in a well written manner; it has been done in hundreds of books and mangas and series and movies before but this one, nah. Since this series tries to merge time travel with multiverse, with supervillains, with gods, with friendship, with love, with humour, and with almost everything else sellable in the world, it forgets to focus and develop any one thing completely. And in the end, we get a mishmash of everything in small quantity and nothing in full. Great ride for those who like to drool over special effects and charisma, and a confused, nonsensical, unimaginative drivel for those who like to search for deeper congruence in their fiction. Full on entertainment with no logic behind it. This is Bollywood at its best. Ah.. I forgot.. it's Hollywood.. but it didn't feel like it.. except for the time when the special effects were used, it didn't feel like even once...I think - to each her own.\",\n",
       " 'If you ever thought \"What is missing from Thor Ragnarok?\" And your answer is \"more admin and paperwork\" then this is the show for you.It\\'s a spin off show with a total different premise.

Ironically time will not look favourably on this woke period of our cultural history.',\n",
       " \"For a show called Loki, it is not what you would expect at all. A series focused on maybe him being a trickster throughout time... The writing and story is awful.The GODD: Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson are great actors, and people would watch it just for Tom Hiddleston's exceptional acting ability.The BAD: No subject matter experts, Comic Book Readers, to reign in these weak writers from creating unrealistic and uncharacteristic narratives.The Ugly: The intentional use of Identity/woke politics messaging over creating a good story. You are alienating 90% of your potential audience with this nonsense instead of creating proper escapism.Comments: Disney pull your head out of your rear end, and strop ruining Marvel.\",\n",

The writer is mindless & those who have rated 10 are also mindless. I loved to watch Marvel movies till Endgame. Now it seems that was the end of Marvel as well.They are just ruining our favourite characters by showing these senseless scripts. If you still want to watch then watch it with no brain because there's no logic,no sense, no science,no magic and no thought as well.Script, casting & direction everything is senseless 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻\",\n",
       " 'Just watched the finale, so I could form my final opinion of the whole season. I love the character of Loki, Tom is always great, but he plays second fiddle in his own show. And that finale... lots of yapping. God, what a disappointing, pedestrian tv show. All the overhyped 10 givers should go out more...',\n",
       " \"Promising start to the show, Hiddleston and Wilson are good together and share some amusing scenes.Then episode three hits and it's all gone horribly wrong, the acting by Loki number 2 is absolutely appalling and their scenes feel so forced.How this has a 9.1 rating is ridiculous, me thinks there may be a few fake reviews perhaps...\",\n",
       " \"Marvel had it's run IMO but I think it's over. I shut it off after first episode.\",\n",
       " \"I'm generally not a fan of the MCU movies. I saw a couple of them but for the most part, to me they felt like homogeneous, fairly bland, and forgottable movies with no real artistic vision behind them - they felt more like well-crafted products than actual art (what a movie is normally supposed to be).I value movies such as Superman, Superman II: The Richard Donner's Cut, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, some of the X-Men movies and Shazam much more - the only real exception is Guardians of the Galaxy 2, which managed to evoke the same kind of magic that I felt while watching those other movies.Why I like these movies? Because they have heart - they touch me on a deep emotional level. Because these movies have a strong artistic vision and it shows. Because these are first and foremost character-driven movies that focus on the everyday struggles and problems of the characters and are just secondarily superhero movies.---And this is the reason why I love Loki too. It's a series that is part of the MCU, yet it feels like anything but a part of it. It feels like the very best that superhero stories can offer. It feels authentic, it feels genuine, it feels heavily artist-driven.Action generally takes a backseat and instead every single episode focuses on building characters, character relationships, and the strange world of the series itself which ultimately makes the series so much better than practically anything you can see in the MCU (although GotG2 is a brillant movie).The main trio of the characters are fantastically realized, loveable and relatable. There are a lot of wholesome, sweet, and truly human moments in the show that remind me of the old Superman movies and the Raimi Spider-Man movies that I mentioned previously.The show also has a great amount of intellectual depth, not just compared to other MCU stories, but in general too (especially in the earlier episodes), exploring interesting concepts such as the existence of free will or pre-determination in a visual way and through cleverly written dialogues.Both the emotional and intellectual scenes serve to build the characters and what is fantastic is that these moments play out effortlessly and naturally, in a very believable manner. The cameran doesn't cut away, the creators are not afraid to make things slower.They smartly let these scenes fully play out, this way making it possible for viewers to fully soak in the moment and for the actors to fully embrace their characters and get the most out of these scenes. This is when this series shines the best and I've only really seen scenes like this in independent, heavily artist-driven, lower-budget movies.On the top of these, the story, the pacing and the overall thematical and logical consistency of the series are also excellent. The story is constantly moving forward without any padding or filler, in fact, so many meaningful things happen in the span of a couple of episodes that it would have taken multiple seasons for other TV shows to tell the same story.Loki is a modern gem that perfectly captures the magic of the greatest superhero movies. I can't recommend it enough.\"]"
