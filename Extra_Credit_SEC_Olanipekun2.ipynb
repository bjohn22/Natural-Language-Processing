    "# Extra Credit Opportuinity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can You Predit a 20 Day Change in Stock Price?\n",
    "* Get 5 points added to your lowest Major Lab grade (Lab 1, 2, or 3) for completing the extra credit. \n",
    "* Get 10 additional points, if you achieve a lower Mean Absolute Error < 25% OR a Correct direction > 57.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions \n",
    "1. Create and execute three original 30 day simulation models (Examples below) trying to improve your MAE each time. \n",
    "2. Pickel your predictions for each run using the .gz file extension and the file names shown below. \n",
    "3. Execute the code in the observations section using the predictions from your best run. \n",
    "4. Update with your own observations. Feel free to add any visuals or tables you need to support your observations.\n",
    "5. State how many Extra Credit points you think you should be awarded.  If you qualify for the 10 additional points, explain how / why you think your model achieves a better result. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules\n",
    "* All extra credit work and submissions must be individual.  Do not share your approaches.    \n",
    "* \"Original\" simualtions include you making changes to the models, parameter tuning, feature selection, feature engineering, training record selection strategies etc. to achieve a better result. \n",
    "* Feel free to run more than three simulations, but only include your best 3 simulations in the final submission. \n",
    "* You MUST use the make_cv_folds() function and the train / test folds it creates for the simulation.  DO NOT modify this code in any way.\n",
    "* You MUST use the example code below to execute your simulations.  \n",
    "* Only modify the simuilation code to improve the model predictions.   \n",
    "* You must make a prediction for each of the 30 days and 2,065 test records as shown below.\n",
    "* You must train your model using some or all of the training data for each respective fold (see examples below).\n",
    "* DO NOT mix folds in any way. Use the simulation examples as a starting point. Training records for each fold are 20 days older than the test records you are trying to predict. \n",
    "* DO NOT add new or future training data to the folds!!! \n",
    "* Simulation predictions must be pickled/saved using the filenames: pred_data_e1.gz, pred_data_e2.gz, and pred_data_e3.gz as shown below.\n",
    "* Your work MUST be reproduceable! I will not award any points if I cannot reproduce your work using the cv_folds below!   \n",
    "* You may use any scikit learn tools to create better predictions.\n",
    "* I WILL MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION ON AWARDING EXTRA CREDIT POINTS. PLEASE ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, DO NOT ASSUME.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Things to Consider Trying\n",
    "* Modify TfidfVectorizer() parameters to make better features. \n",
    "* Use different models or model ensembles.\n",
    "* Use sklearn.feature_selection (SelectFromModel, SelectKBest) to select better features.\n",
    "* Try out the AdaBoostRegressor()\n",
    "* Try dimensionality reduction or remove very rare features from the TfidfVectorizer's sparse matrix.  "

MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must-have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. Since fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our own stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens, Women\\\\\\'s and Kids\\\\\\'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Women\\\\\\'s and Kids\\\\\\' businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. As a result of our strategic acceleration, management announced on July 22, 2020, a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our execution. These changes will result in a net reduction of our global workforce and we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $315 million, the majority of which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. These amounts reflect the continued evaluation and variability of our original estimate of employee termination costs and required changes in assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $218 million and expect all remaining actions to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 14  Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. COVID-19 UPDATE The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business results and operations globally, causing us to transform the way we operate in order to better serve our consumers. Although uncertainty due to the pandemic continues to exist, our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 demonstrate our ability to navigate the dynamic situation. Despite physical retail traffic being below prior year levels, Revenues grew 9% and 4% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively, and 7% and 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Through our intentional supply and demand management, inventory levels have declined, and we ended the second quarter of fiscal 2021 with Inventories down 17% compared to May 31, 2020. We reduced discretionary spending while continuing to invest in our digital transformation. As a result, total selling and administrative expense declined 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the first six months of fiscal 2021. However, we expect Demand creation expense to increase in future periods as major sporting events and key sports moments resume following recovery from the pandemic, along with investments in strategic areas to drive growth. Our liquidity position remains strong and we ended the second quarter with $11.8 billion of Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments. Our NIKE Direct business continues to fuel our growth as we navigate through the pandemic, leveraging our digital assets with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 were $4.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, growing 30% and 22%, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Brand digital remained our fastest growing channel, with growth of 80% and 81% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced temporary store closures in geographies affected by rising COVID-19 cases; however, more than 80% of our owned stores were open as of January 4, 2021, with some operating on reduced hours. Despite a substantial majority of stores being open during the quarter, we experienced a 25 Table of Contents decline in comparable store sales in EMEA, North America and APLA, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19. We continue to monitor the ongoing and evolving situation, as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, we expect that fiscal 2021 will continue to be a time of uncertainty across each of our geographies and we expect each market recovery will be dynamic. While our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 are positive, there remains the risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets, revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Company\\\\\\'s jurisdictions. SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 9% to $11.2 billion compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, Revenues increased 7%. Net income was $1,251 million and diluted earnings per common share was $0.78 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to Net income of $1,115 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.70 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes increased 17% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense, partially offset by a decline in gross margin. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 8%, driven by higher revenues across all geographies, footwear and apparel, as well as growth in most key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Revenues for Converse decreased 1% and 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, as double-digit growth in digital and growth in Asia were more than offset by declines in Europe and North America, primarily due to tighter supply and strategic distribution shifts. Our effective tax rate was 14.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and an increase in tax associated with the recent finalization of U.S. tax regulations, partially offset by a more favorable impact from stock-based compensation. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating model. The transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed on December 1, 2020, subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKEs businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor partnership. However, as we remain committed to selling our NIKE Brand businesses in all three countries to third-party distributors, the assets and liabilities of the entities will remain classified as held-for-sale on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information see Note 13  Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company\\\\\\'s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Revenues $ 11,243 $ 10,326 9 % $ 21,837 $ 20,986 4 % Cost of sales 6,396 5,782 11 % 12,249 11,571 6 % Gross profit 4,847 4,544 7 % 9,588 9,415 2 % Gross margin 43.1 % 44.0 % 43.9 % 44.9 % Demand creation expense 729 881 -17 % 1,406 1,899 -26 % Operating overhead expense 2,538 2,443 4 % 4,836 4,753 2 % Total selling and administrative expense 3,267 3,324 -2 % 6,242 6,652 -6 % % of revenues 29.1 % 32.2 % 28.6 % 31.7 % Interest expense (income), net 70 12  135 27  Other (income) expense, net 54 (41)  40 (74)  Income before income taxes 1,456 1,249 17 % 3,171 2,810 13 % Income tax expense 205 134 53 % 402 328 23 % Effective tax rate 14.1 % 10.7 % 12.7 % 11.7 % NET INCOME $ 1,251 $ 1,115 12 % $ 2,769 $ 2,482 12 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.78 $ 0.70 11 % $ 1.73 $ 1.56 11 % 27 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS REVENUES THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) NIKE, Inc.

(2) Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment. (3) Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, due to growth across all NIKE Brand geographies, partially offset by lower revenues in Converse. Higher revenues in Greater China and EMEA each contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with APLA contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 8%, driven by growth in most key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines in Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 4% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher full-price ASP, on a wholesale equivalent basis. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues grew 7%, reflecting higher revenues in several key categories, most notably Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 2 percentage points. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, as well as an unfavorable full-price mix. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 40% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 33% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Digital sales were $2.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, driven by digital sales growth of 80%, which more than offset comparable store sales declines of 4% primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Comparable store sales, which exclude digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating 28 Table of Contents decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 4% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by growth in Greater China and EMEA, partially offset by lower revenues in APLA. Higher revenues in Greater China and EMEA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 7%, driven by growth in several key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 2% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues were flat as growth in Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand, was offset by declines in all other key categories. Unit sales of apparel increased 1%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, as well as unfavorable full-price mix, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 38% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to 33% for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Digital sales were $4.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $2.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 22% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by digital sales growth of 81%, partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales driven by reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . GROSS MARGIN THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Gross Profit $ 4,847 $ 4,544 7 % $ 9,588 $ 9,415 2 % Gross Margin 43.1 % 44.0 % (90) bps 43.9 % 44.9 % (100) bps For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, our consolidated gross margin was 90 and 100 basis points lower than the respective prior year period and reflected unfavorable impacts from COVID-19. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the change in gross margin primarily reflected the following factors:  Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, reflecting higher promotions to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19 (decreasing gross margin approximately 80 basis points);  Lower mix of full-price sales (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points);  Higher other costs, in part reflecting higher warehousing and freight as well as restructuring-related costs related to our organizational realignment, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);  Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points); and  Lower NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, due to favorable product mix, lower air freight and reduced tariffs in North America (increasing gross margin approximately 110 basis points). For the first six months of fiscal 2021, the change in gross margin primarily reflected the following factors:  Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, reflecting higher promotions to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19 (decreasing gross margin approximately 120 basis points);  Lower mix of full-price sales (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points);  Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points);  Higher other costs, in part reflecting higher warehousing and freight as well as restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence and the favorable impact from the release of factory cancellation cost accruals due to higher than anticipated consumer demand (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points); and  Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 110 basis points). 29 Table of Contents TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Demand creation expense (1) $ 729 $ 881 -17 % $ 1,406 $ 1,899 -26 % Operating overhead expense 2,538 2,443 4 % 4,836 4,753 2 % Total selling and administrative expense $ 3,267 $ 3,324 -2 % $ 6,242 $ 6,652 -6 % % of revenues 29.1 % 32.2 % (310) bps 28.6 % 31.7 % (310) bps (1) Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 Demand creation expense decreased 17% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due primarily to lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in sports marketing expense and retail brand presentation costs as a result of COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by an increase in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point. Operating overhead expense increased 4% primarily due to $137 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as continued investments in digital capabilities to support the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy. These costs were slightly offset by disciplined expense management including lower wage-related expenses and lower travel and related costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Demand creation expense decreased 26% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in sports marketing expense and retail brand presentation costs as a result of COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by an increase in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased 2%, primarily due to $184 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as our continued investments in digital capabilities, partially offset by lower travel and related expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Operating overhead expense.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Other (income) expense, net changed from $41 million of other income, net to $54 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to a net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, as well as a charge related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, Other (income) expense, net changed from $74 million of other income, net to $40 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to charges related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as a net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.

We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had favorable impacts of approximately $10 million and unfavorable impacts of approximately $28 million on our Income before income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively. 30 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Effective tax rate 14.1 % 10.7 % 340 bps 12.7 % 11.7 % 100 bps Our effective tax rate was 14.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and an increase in tax associated with the recent finalization of U.S. tax regulations, partially offset by a more favorable impact from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate was 12.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to 11.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and the recognition of a reserve in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 related to Altera Corp. v.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\\\\\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. The Company\\\\\\'s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity\\\\\\'s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our differentiated strategic wholesale customers and over the last three years have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated accounts. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers. We expect over the next two fiscal years, we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines over time. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 1%, largely driven by significant growth in digital. NIKE Direct revenues increased 32% as strong digital sales growth of 107% more than offset an 11% decline in comparable store sales primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Footwear revenues increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis, largely driven by significant growth in digital. Unit sales of footwear decreased 4%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs. 33 Table of Contents On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues decreased 3%, as growth in Sportswear was more than offset by lower revenues in several key categories, led by Training, and the divestiture of Hurley in the prior year. Unit sales of apparel were flat while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. The decrease in ASP per unit was primarily driven by lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher NIKE Direct ASP. Reported EBIT increased 17% driven by lower selling and administrative expense, gross margin expansion and higher revenues. Gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to lower product costs reflecting the impact of lower air freight and reduced tariffs, as well as lower inventory obsolescence. These impacts were partially offset by lower full-price ASP, reflecting higher discounts to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19 and a lower mix of full-price sales. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense reflected lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower wage-related expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2021 were flat as growth in Sportswear was offset by declines in nearly all other key categories, led by Training and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 18%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 103%, partially offset by comparable store sales contraction of 25%, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Footwear revenues increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in Sportswear was partially offset by declines in nearly all other key categories, led by Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues decreased 12%, driven by declines in most key categories, led by Training, NIKE Basketball, as well as the divestiture of Hurley in the prior year. Unit sales of apparel declined 10% and lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 2 percentage points. The decrease in ASP per unit was driven by lower full-price ASP and a lower mix of full-price sales, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher NIKE Direct ASP. Reported EBIT increased 18% driven by lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased approximately 130 basis points due to higher full-price ASP and lower other costs, partially offset by lower margin in our NIKE Direct business and a lower mix of full-price sales. The decrease in other costs was primarily a result of lower inventory obsolescence and the favorable impact from the release of factory cancellation cost accruals due to an increase in consumer demand. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing costs, retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expense, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower wage-related expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services costs.

Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower NIKE Direct ASP and a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, as well as lower off-price ASP, which more than offset higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts. Reported EBIT increased 29% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 200 basis points as lower product costs due to favorable product mix were more than offset by unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, and a lower mix of full-price sales. Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business was driven by higher promotions to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19.

Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing expense, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Global Brand Divisions\\\\\\' loss before interest and taxes decreased 2% for the first six months of fiscal 2021 driven by lower total selling and administrative expense. Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing costs. The decrease in operating overhead expense was primarily due lower travel and related expenses as well as lower wage-related costs, partially offset by our continued investment in digital capabilities. 38 CONVERSE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES Revenues by: Footwear $ 416 $ 416 0 % -3 % $ 929 $ 912 2 % 1 % Apparel 32 30 7 % 0 % 54 56 -4 % -6 % Equipment 7 6 17 % 19 % 16 15 7 % 8 % Other (1) 21 28 -25 % -19 % 40 52 -23 % -18 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 476 $ 480 -1 % -4 % $ 1,039 $ 1,035 0 % -1 % Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $ 259 $ 286 -9 % -13 % $ 632 $ 653 -3 % -5 % Sales through Direct to Consumer 196 166 18 % 15 % 367 330 11 % 10 % Other (1) 21 28 -25 % -19 % 40 52 -23 % -18 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 476 $ 480 -1 % -4 % $ 1,039 $ 1,035 0 % -1 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $ 87 $ 90 -3 % $ 255 $ 228 12 % (1) Other revenues consist of territories serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues decreased 4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in revenues was driven by declines in wholesale revenues in North America and Europe as a result of supply chain management and strategic distribution shifts, partially offset by growth in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 15%, as strong digital sales growth across all geographies more than offset declines from Converse owned stores, reflecting the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 11%, while ASP increased 9%, primarily due to growth in digital. Reported EBIT decreased 3%, driven by declines in gross margin, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 230 basis points as higher full-price ASP due to product mix was offset by lower margin in our direct to consumer channel, higher product costs due to product mix, a lower mix of full-price sales, lower revenues in our licensing business and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Lower margin in direct to consumer was driven by higher promotions to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19. Selling and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower operating overhead, partially offset by increased demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower travel and related expenses. Demand creation expense increased primarily as a result of higher advertising costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues decreased 1% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by lower wholesale revenues in North America, as a result of supply chain management and strategic distribution shifts, partially offset by growth in Asia.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 Corporate\\\\\\'s loss before interest and taxes increased $305 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:  an unfavorable change of $276 million in part due to $171 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as a charge related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA;  an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $53 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net; and  a favorable change of $24 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Corporate\\\\\\'s loss before interest and taxes increased $378 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:  an unfavorable change of $416 million in part due to $218 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as charges related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA;  a favorable change of $100 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and  an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $62 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net . For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 13  Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 14  Restructuring, respectively, within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of and for the six months ended November 30, 2020, there have been no material changes to the Company\\\\\\'s hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 4  Fair Value Measurements and Note 9  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. For additional information about our Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices refer to Part II, Item 7. Management\\\\\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:  Product Costs  Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity and factory input costs from the foreign currency adjustments program with certain factories.  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in Other (income) expense, net. 41 Table of Contents TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries\\\\\\' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders\\\\\\' equity. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $184 million and $73 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively, and a detriment of approximately $233 million and $546 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2019, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $63 million and $34 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively, and a detriment of approximately $66 million and $152 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2019, respectively. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates. MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $10 million and an unfavorable impact of approximately $28 million on our Income before income taxes for the three months and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $3,355 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $1,306 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,283 million of operating cash inflow for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $2,906 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of $72 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to a decrease of $1,600 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. This favorable impact on Cash provided (used) by operations was primarily the result of a $1,929 million decrease in Inventories driven by our intentional supply and demand management, as well as strong digital sales growth. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $2,877 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $788 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, driven by the net change in short-term investments. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $2,789 million compared to $157 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $292 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $1,868 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, with the decrease from the prior period driven by our election to temporarily suspend share repurchases, resulting in no share repurchases for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $1,921 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020. 42 Table of Contents As of November 30, 2020, we had repurchased 45.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $4.0 billion (an average price of $89.00 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. To enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. As such, there were no share repurchases made during the quarter ended November 30, 2020. The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022. Our committed credit facilities remain unchanged from the information previously reported on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. As of November 30, 2020 and May 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor\\\\\\'s Corporation and Moody\\\\\\'s Investor Services, respectively. Any changes to these ratings could result in interest rate and facility fee changes. As of November 30, 2020, we were in full compliance of the covenants under our committed credit facilities and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of the covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $4 billion commercial paper program. During the three months ended November 30, 2020, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $112 million. As of November 30, 2020 and May 31, 2020, the Company had $23 million and $248 million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.76% and 1.65%, respectively. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor\\\\\\'s Corporation and Moody\\\\\\'s Investor Services, respectively. To date, in fiscal 2021, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of November 30, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $11.8 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of November 30, 2020, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. Given our existing structure, if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of November 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS There have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. 43 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the Management\\\\\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"the Exchange Act\") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\\\'s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2020. We are continuing several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout these transformation initiatives. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 45 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ANALYST REPORTS Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

OVERVIEW NIKE designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world We sell our products through NIKEowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses Our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative musthave products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail Since fiscal two thousand and eighteen through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers In June two thousand and twenty we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy Consumer Direct Acceleration This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas First creating the marketplace of the future through more premium consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision Second we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens Womens and Kids This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs including more specialization of our category approach while realigning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities In particular we expect to reinvest in our Womens and Kids businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness Third we will unify investments in data and analytics demand sensing insight gathering inventory management and other areas against an endtoend technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally As a result of our strategic acceleration management announced on July twentytwo two thousand and twenty a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our execution These changes will result in a net reduction of our global workforce and we expect to incur pretax charges of approximately three hundred and fifteen million the majority of which relate to employee termination costs and to a lesser extent stockbased compensation expense These amounts reflect the continued evaluation and variability of our original estimate of employee termination costs and required changes in assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense For the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone we incurred pretax charges of two hundred and eighteen million and expect all remaining actions to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal two thousand and twentyone We expect future annual wagerelated savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs see Note fourteen Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements COVID19 UPDATE The COVID19 pandemic continues to impact our business results and operations globally causing us to transform the way we operate in order to better serve our consumers Although uncertainty due to the pandemic continues to exist our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone demonstrate our ability to navigate the dynamic situation Despite physical retail traffic being below prior year levels Revenues grew nine and four for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone respectively and seven and four on a currencyneutral basis Through our intentional supply and demand management inventory levels have declined and we ended the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone with Inventories down seventeen compared to May thirtyone two thousand and twenty We reduced discretionary spending while continuing to invest in our digital transformation As a result total selling and administrative expense declined two for the second quarter and six for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone However we expect Demand creation expense to increase in future periods as major sporting events and key sports moments resume following recovery from the pandemic along with investments in strategic areas to drive growth Our liquidity position remains strong and we ended the second quarter with one hundred and eighteen billion of Cash and equivalents and Shortterm investments Our NIKE Direct business continues to fuel our growth as we navigate through the pandemic leveraging our digital assets with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer On a reported basis NIKE Direct sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone were fortythree billion and eighty billion respectively growing thirty and twentytwo respectively on a currencyneutral basis NIKE Brand digital remained our fastest growing channel with growth of eighty and eightyone for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone respectively During the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone we experienced temporary store closures in geographies affected by rising COVID19 cases however more than eighty of our owned stores were open as of January four two thousand and twentyone with some operating on reduced hours Despite a substantial majority of stores being open during the quarter we experienced a twentyfive Table of Contents decline in comparable store sales in EMEA North America and APLA primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic in part resulting from safetyrelated measures in response to COVID19 We continue to monitor the ongoing and evolving situation as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations In these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan As such we expect that fiscal two thousand and twentyone will continue to be a time of uncertainty across each of our geographies and we expect each market recovery will be dynamic While our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone are positive there remains the risk that COVID19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers higher salesrelated reserves and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Companys jurisdictions SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW For the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone NIKE Inc Revenues increased nine to one hundred and twelve billion compared to the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty On a currencyneutral basis Revenues increased seven Net income was one thousand two hundred and fiftyone million and diluted earnings per common share was seventyeight for the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to Net income of one thousand one hundred and fifteen million and diluted earnings per common share of seventy for the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty Income before income taxes increased seventeen compared to the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty primarily due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense partially offset by a decline in gross margin The NIKE Brand which represents over ninety of NIKE Inc Revenues increased nine compared to the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Brand revenues grew eight driven by higher revenues across all geographies footwear and apparel as well as growth in most key categories primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand Revenues for Converse decreased one and four on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively as doubledigit growth in digital and growth in Asia were more than offset by declines in Europe and North America primarily due to tighter supply and strategic distribution shifts Our effective tax rate was one hundred and fortyone for the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to one hundred and seven for the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the US and an increase in tax associated with the recent finalization of US tax regulations partially offset by a more favorable impact from stockbased compensation During the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil Argentina Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating model The transaction with Grupo SBF SA to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed on December one two thousand and twenty subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone Additionally subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKEs businesses in Argentina Chile and Uruguay to a distributor partnership However as we remain committed to selling our NIKE Brand businesses in all three countries to thirdparty distributors the assets and liabilities of the entities will remain classified as heldforsale on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets For more information see Note thirteen Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements USE OF NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q we discuss nonGAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues currencyneutral revenues as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes EBIT and Total NIKE Inc EBIT which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of one sales to external wholesale customers and two internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers Currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense income net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income Management uses these nonGAAP financial measures when evaluating the Companys performance including when making financial and operating decisions Additionally management believes these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends However references to wholesale equivalent revenues currencyneutral revenues and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled nonGAAP measures used by other companies twentysix Table

realignment and related costs see Note thirteen Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note fourteen Restructuring respectively within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements forty Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes As of and for the six months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty there have been no material changes to the Companys hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within the Annual Report on Form 10K Refer to Note four Fair Value Measurements and Note nine Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end For additional information about our Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices refer to Part II Item seven Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May thirtyone two thousand and twenty TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity and factory input costs from the foreign currency adjustments program with certain factories NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in Other income expense net fortyone Table of Contents TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately one hundred and eightyfour million and seventythree million for the three and six months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty respectively and a detriment of approximately two hundred and thirtythree million and five hundred and fortysix million for the three and six months ended November thirty two thousand and nineteen respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately sixtythree million and thirtyfour million for the three and six months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty respectively and a detriment of approximately sixtysix million and one hundred and fiftytwo million for the three and six months ended November thirty two thousand and nineteen respectively Management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds one hundred Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market As a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and nineteen the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the US Dollar As of and for the three and six months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had a favorable impact of approximately ten million and an unfavorable impact of approximately twentyeight million on our Income before income taxes for the three months and six months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty respectively LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided used by operations was an inflow of three thousand three hundred and fiftyfive million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to one thousand three hundred and six million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty Net income adjusted for noncash items generated three thousand two hundred and eightythree million of operating cash inflow for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to two thousand nine hundred and six million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided used by operations of seventytwo million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to a decrease of one thousand six hundred million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty This favorable impact on Cash provided used by operations was primarily the result of a one thousand nine hundred and twentynine million decrease in Inventories driven by our intentional supply and demand management as well as strong digital sales growth Cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of two thousand eight hundred and seventyseven million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to seven hundred and eightyeight million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty driven by the net change in shortterm investments For the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone the net change in shortterm investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash outflow of two thousand seven hundred and eightynine million compared to one hundred and fiftyseven million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty Cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of two hundred and ninetytwo million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to one thousand eight hundred and sixtyeight million for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty with the decrease from the prior period driven by our election to temporarily suspend share repurchases resulting in no share repurchases for the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twentyone compared to one thousand nine hundred and twentyone million in the first six months of fiscal two thousand and twenty fortytwo Table of Contents As of November thirty two thousand and twenty we had repurchased four hundred and fiftytwo million shares at a cost of approximately forty billion an average price of eight thousand nine hundred per share under the fouryear fifteen billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June two thousand and eighteen To enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID19 during the fourth quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program As such there were no share repurchases made during the quarter ended November thirty two thousand and twenty The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending upon market conditions our capital needs and other factors We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt CAPITAL RESOURCES On July twentythree two thousand and nineteen we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expires on July twentythree two thousand and twentytwo Our committed credit facilities remain unchanged from the information previously reported on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May thirtyone two thousand and twenty As of November thirty two thousand and twenty and May thirtyone two thousand and twenty no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively Any changes to these ratings could result in interest rate and facility fee changes As of November thirty two thousand and twenty we were in full compliance of the covenants under our committed credit facilities and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of the covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by our four billion commercial paper program During the three months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was one hundred and twelve million As of November thirty two thousand and twenty and May thirtyone two thousand and twenty the Company had twentythree million and two hundred and fortyeight million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of one hundred and seventysix and one hundred and sixtyfive respectively We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively To date in fiscal two thousand and twentyone we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of November thirty two thousand and twenty we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling one hundred and eighteen billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds US government sponsored enterprise obligations US Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of November thirty two thousand and twenty the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was thirtythree days We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings Should we require additional capital in the United States we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt Given our existing structure if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of November thirty two thousand and twenty we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS There have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May thirtyone two thousand and twenty NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May thirtyone two thousand and twenty fortythree Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities We believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10K have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies Actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported fortyfour Table of Contents ITEM three QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes from the information previously

will allow the Company to increase the minimum number of clinics to six hundred and expand the rollout at a faster pace See Note nineteen Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY The Company has been and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations These factors include the impact of the coronavirus COVID19 COVID19 pandemic on our operations and financial results the financial performance of our equity method investees including AmerisourceBergen the influence of certain holidays seasonality foreign currency rates changes in vendor payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure strategic transactions and acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic collaborations changes in laws including US tax law changes changes in trade tariffs including trade relations between the US and China and international relations including the UKs withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives including under our Transformational Cost Management Program as defined below the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season fluctuations in variable costs the impacts of looting natural disasters war terrorism and other catastrophic events and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates These and other factors can affect the Companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results Estimated COVID19 impacts and uncertainties COVID19 has severely impacted and is expected to continue to impact the economies of the US the UK and other countries around the world COVID19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations Further financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID19 have resulted in among other things temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in US UK and other countries reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of workfromhome policies COVID19 continued to affect global economic conditions during the three months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty The Company expects this will continue in the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone including a weaker cough cold and flu season The situation surrounding COVID19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers government officials team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as developments in our business As COVID19 impacts the economies of the US UK and other countries around the world the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe During the three months ended November thirty two thousand and twenty we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID19 Sales were negatively impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division This reflected a reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores as a second national lockdown was declared in November and social distancing measures remained in place Globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and gross margin was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs in the UK The Company took measures to keep stores open incurring incremental selling general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning and COVID19 drivethru testing

beginning in March two thousand and twenty and many continue to work remotely While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter as further described in Item four Controls and procedures below The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness The Company anticipates additional mandates and directives including revisions thereto from foreign federal state county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID19 pandemic and for some time thereafter The impact of this activity on the US and global economies and consumer customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors

QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Item three Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variablerate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variablerate debt which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates such as US treasury rates and commercial paper rates From time to time the Company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt Generally under these swaps the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount The Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority the FCA which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR has announced that the FCA will no longer compel LIBOR panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after two thousand and twentyone That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis will not be guaranteed after two thousand and twentyone Moreover it is possible that LIBOR may be discontinued prior to the end of two thousand and twentyone Certain of our credit facilities provide that under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the US market for alternative benchmarks Such alternative benchmark rate could include the secured overnight financing rate also known as SOFR published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Information regarding the Companys transactions are set forth in Note eight Financial instruments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates On November thirty two thousand and twenty the Company had no material longterm debt obligations that had floating interest rates The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro and certain other foreign currencies which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the US dollar The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows These transactions are almost exclusively less than twelve months in maturity In addition the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions The Companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates A hypothetical one change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the US dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of November thirty two thousand and twenty by approximately thirtytwo million The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note five Equity method investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements See Investment in AmerisourceBergen above WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10Q fiftyfive WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE INC AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM four CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Item four Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10Q The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO As of the end of the period covered by this report the Company had completed the creation of a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany with McKesson Corporation The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination The scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staffs general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of managements assessment for one year following the acquisition The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets however is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions which were included in managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of November thirty two thousand and twenty Based upon the controls evaluation our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the CEO and CFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Changes in internal control over financial reporting In the ordinary course of business the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems automating manual processes standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls As a result of COVID19 a portion of our global workforce including employees and extended workforce rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in March two thousand and twenty and many continue to work remotely While our controls were not developed and designed to facilitate or accommodate this shift we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter As we transform our business processes we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via thirdparty outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems Specifically the Company is currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning ERP system This project is a multiyear initiative and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes as well as the underlying systems environment These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness As these changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a15d of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15f by the Companys management including its CEO and CFO no changes during the quarter ended November thirty two thousand and twenty were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management including the CEO and CFO do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the Company have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions Projections of any evaluation of controls WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10Q fiftysix WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE INC AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM four CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks Over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures Part II Other Information Item one Legal proceedings The information in response to this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note ten Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report Item one hundred and three of SEC Regulation SK requires disclosure of environmental legal proceedings with or any such legal proceedings known to be contemplated by a governmental authority if management reasonably believes that the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs above the lesser of ten million or one of the Companys current assets As previously disclosed the Company has been under investigation by certain counties within the State of California for alleged noncompliance with state hazardous waste regulations The Company has worked with state and local officials in an effort to resolve this matter On November sixteen two thousand and twenty a number of California District Attorneys submitted a complaint and a signed settlement agreement to a California state court in Alameda County People of the State of California v Walgreen Co Case No RG20081172 for review and approval If approved by the court the settlement which includes certain injunctive relief would require the Company to pay penalties and costs and fund supplemental

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, and in item 1A, risk factors, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020.

(Walgreens Boots Alliance) and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (sometimes referred to herein as \"divisions\"):  Retail Pharmacy USA;  Retail Pharmacy International; and  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. See Note 14, Segment reporting and Note 15, Sales to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Pharmaceutical Wholesale Transaction On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with AmerisourceBergen. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s Alliance Healthcare business (\"Business\") for approximately $ billion, comprised of $ billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (the \"Transaction\").

See Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY The Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK\\\\\\'s withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Estimated COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties COVID-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in U.S., UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies. COVID-19 continued to affect global economic conditions during the three months ended November 30, 2020. The Company expects this will continue in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 (including a weaker cough, cold and flu season). The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. As COVID-19 impacts the economies of the U.S., UK and other countries around the world, the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe. During the three months ended November 30, 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19. Sales were negatively impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division. This reflected a reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores as a second national lockdown was declared in November and social distancing measures remained in place. Globally, pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and gross margin was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs in the UK. The Company took measures to keep stores open, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning and COVID-19 drive-thru testing sites expenses. The Company also took certain actions during the three months ended November 30, 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations. However, operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the three months ended November 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. It has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and may continue to do so in the future. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 34 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The Company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital \\\\\\'order ahead\\\\\\' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up and curbside collection, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S. To continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the Company launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses in fiscal 2020. Since the launch of the program, the Company has administered more than 2.8 million COVID-19 tests across the US. The Company has worked with the federal and state government to help administer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and staff at more than 35,000 long-term care facilities in 49 states. The opportunity from the distribution of vaccinations is likely to be partly offset by new COVID-19 related lock-downs and restrictions, and by increased growth investments. As a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter, as further described in Item 4. Controls and procedures below. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness. The Company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact of this activity on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to COVID-19. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. However, the future impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business or other actions; impacts on our supply chain; the effect on customer demand; store closures or changes and our operations. The health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted but is vital to our operations. The impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. Further, additional waves of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond could cause many of the impacts to the Company described herein to return or be exacerbated. The circumstances, containment and impacts of COVID-19 remain fluid due to rising incident rates and associated additional lockdowns. The Companys current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and in Item 1A, Risk factors, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany On November 1, 2020, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany, as part of a strategic alliance. The Company owns a % controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company and reported within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $ million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in the combined business. See Note 2, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. The potential impacts of Brexit As a result of a referendum in June 2016, the UK withdrew from the European Union (Brexit) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services that ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK agreed to a trade deal with no tariffs nor quotas on products, regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition. Since the referendum, there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the UK. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the agreed Brexit trade deal will have on our business, particularly our UK and other European WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 35 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. TRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that is currently expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program). The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Companys information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Companys global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Companys segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including current plans to close approximately 200 Boots stores in the UK and approximately 250 stores in the U.S.. The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will be associated with cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation costs and lease and real estate payments. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows: Transformational Cost Management Program Activities Range of Charges Lease obligations and other real estate costs 1 $350 to 400 million Asset impairments 2 $350 to 400 million Employee severance and business transition costs $850 to 950 million Information technology transformation and other exit costs $250 to 300 million Total cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal costs $1.8 to 2.1 billion Other IT transformation costs $300 to 350 million Total estimated pre-tax costs $2.1 to 2.4 billion 1 Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets. 2 Primarily related to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs. In addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) on September 1, 2019. Since the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to November 30, 2020, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion are recorded as exit and disposal activities. See Note 3, Exit and disposal activities, for additional information. These charges included $264 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $354 million in asset impairments, $471 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $146 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs and $139 million other information technology costs. Costs under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019, were as follows (in millions): WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 36 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. INVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN As of November 30, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 28% of its outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the investment classified within the operating income (loss) of the Companys Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Note 5, Equity method investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale operations, among other assets, for $6.275 billion in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2 million shares of common stock of AmerisourceBergen. See Recent Developments above and Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 37 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 38 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net earnings (loss) Net loss attributable to the Company for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $308 million compared to net earnings of $845 million for the prior year period. Diluted net loss per share was $0.36 compared to diluted net earnings $0.95 for the prior year quarter. The decreases in net earnings and diluted earnings per share are primarily due to the charges reflected in the Company\\\\\\'s equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen. Other income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $60 million compared to income of $35 million for the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting equity earnings from other equity investments. Interest was a net expense of $140 million and $166 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was 38.2% compared to 3.6% for the prior year quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was primarily due to the discrete tax effect of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP measure) Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased 13.9% to $1.1 billion, a decrease of 14.3% on a constant currency basis, compared with the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share decreased 11.2% to $1.22, a decrease of 11.6% on a constant currency basis, compared with the prior year quarter. The decreases in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020 primarily reflect COVID-19 impacts across the retail businesses and lower U.S. pharmacy reimbursement, partially offset by cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program, U.S. retail gross margin and U.S. pharmacy procurement savings. The decrease in adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was partially offset by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year quarter.

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 4 Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 increased 3.9% compared with the prior year quarter to $27.2 billion. Comparable sales increased 3.7% compared with the prior year quarter. Pharmacy sales increased 5.9% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared with the prior year quarter and represented 76.8% of the divisions sales. The increase is primarily due to lower generic utilization and higher volume. In the prior year quarter, pharmacy sales increased 2.9% and represented 75.4% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.0% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to an increase of 2.5% in the prior year quarter. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.4% in the WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 40 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a reduction of 2.5% in the prior year quarter. The effect of generics mix on division sales caused a reduction of 0.3% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.8% for the prior year quarter. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.5% of prescription sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 96.9% in the prior year quarter. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was 204.6 million compared to 213.0 million in the prior year quarter. Prescriptions (including immunizations) filled adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 297.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 294.0 million in the prior year quarter. Retail sales decreased 2.2% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared with the prior year quarter and represented 23.1% of the divisions sales. In the prior year quarter, retail sales decreased 2.2% and comprised 24.6% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales increased 0.4% in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a decrease of 0.5% in the prior year quarter . The current period was impacted by a weaker cough, cold and flu season and decrease in discretionary categories offset by increase in health and wellness, excluding cough, cold and flu categories. Operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased 6.6% compared with the prior year quarter to $792 million. The decrease was primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and adverse COVID-19 impacts partly offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program and acquisition-related costs related to Rite Aid stores in the prior year quarter results. Gross margin was 20.7% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 21.8% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted in the current period by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 impacts. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 17.8% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 18.5% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program partially offset by COVID-19 impacts and higher growth investment. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared with the prior year quarter 14.4% to $989 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins which were negatively impacted by increased reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 impacts. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures. Retail Pharmacy International This division comprises the Company\\\\\\'s retail pharmacy businesses operating in countries outside the U.S. and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the divisions results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively. Comparable retail sales in constant currency for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers methods. The Company presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures. Sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year quarter 6.2% to $2.6 billion. Sales were positively impacted in the quarter by 1.9 percentage points ($53 million) as a result of currency translation. Comparable sales in constant currency decreased 3.1%, primarily due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, including COVID-19 impacts. Pharmacy sales increased 0.1% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to the prior year quarter and represented 38.9% of the divisions sales. The positive impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales in the quarter was 1.5 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 3.8% from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher National Health Service (\"NHS\") reimbursement levels in the UK and pharmacy volumes in Mexico. This is partially offset by lower UK prescription volume and reduced demand for pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 42 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Retail sales decreased 9.8% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to the prior year quarter and represented 61.1% of the divisions sales. The positive impact of currency translation on retail sales in the quarter was 2.2 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 7.6% from the prior year quarter reflecting lower retail sales in Boots UK, including COVID-19 impacts. Operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year quarter 22.7% to $34 million. The decrease reflects increased investment in the Transformational Cost Management Program. Excluding the impact of the increased investment in the Transformational Cost Management Program, the lower footfall is fully mitigated by decisive cost management actions and strong performance of Boots.com. Gross profit decreased 9.0% from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the quarter was positively impacted by 2.3 percentage points ($24 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and higher fulfillment costs partially offset by favorable timing of NHS reimbursement. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8.4% from the prior year quarter. Expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by 2.0 percentage points ($21 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was due to short term cost mitigation and savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 36.0% in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 36.9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions adjusted operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 increased 6.4% to $84 million compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was positively impacted by 5.8 percentage points ($5 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was mainly due to decisive cost management actions and strong performance of Boots.com mitigating the impact of lower footfall.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale This division includes the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale businesses operating in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the British pound sterling, Euro and Turkish lira, and thus the divisions results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 3, Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, for further information on currency risk. On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale operations, among other assets, for $6.275 billion in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2 million shares of common stock of AmerisourceBergen.

Comparable sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures below. Sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020, including results of the Company\\\\\\'s new combined business in Germany which were consolidated as of November, increased 18.6% compared to the prior year quarter to $7.1 billion. Sales were positively impacted in the quarter by 2.3 percentage points ($137 million) as a result of currency translation. Comparable sales in constant currency which exclude the incremental impact of the joint venture, increased 8.3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in emerging markets and COVID-19 related sales in France. Operating income (loss) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions operating loss for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $1.3 billion, including $1.4 billion loss from the Company\\\\\\'s share of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. This compared with operating income of $122 million in the prior year quarter, including $13 million from the Company\\\\\\'s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Operating loss in the quarter was negatively impacted by 1.8 percentage points ($2 million) as a result of currency translation. The operating loss is primarily due to $1.4 billion related to the Company\\\\\\'s share of equity loss in AmerisourceBergen, partially offset by sales growth. Gross profit increased 8.5% from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the quarter was positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points ($12 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the currency translation impact, the increase was primarily due to sales growth partially offset by lower gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.6% from the prior year quarter. Expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by 3.5 percentage points ($14 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the currency translation impact, the increase was due to additional costs due to impact of sales growth and from the company\\\\\\'s new joint venture in Germany. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2020 were 6.4% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to sales growth and a higher contribution of adjusted equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures. NON-GAAP MEASURES The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the SEC, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company\\\\\\'s management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented. The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020. 2 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and inventory valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangibles assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Companys GAAP financial statements, the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments excludes the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. 3 Transformational Cost Management Program and Store Optimization Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 4 The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (FIFO) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. 5 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger and acquisition related activities. These costs include all charges incurred on certain mergers and acquisition related activities, for example, including costs related to integration efforts for successful merger and acquisition activities. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger and acquisition related activities and do not reflect the Companys current operating performance. 6 Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Companys net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within other income (expense). We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Companys operational performance. 7 Includes significant gain on sale of equity method investment and related adjustments. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 47 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 8 Adjustments to income tax provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. tax law changes, a UK tax rate change and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit). 9 Adjustments to post tax equity earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Companys non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings (loss) from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. 10 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020. 11 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes for the three months ended November 30, 2020. The Company considers certain metrics presented in this report, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Companys management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this report, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of November 30, 2020, compared to $0.8 billion (including $0.3 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of November 30, 2019. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds. The Company\\\\\\'s long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Companys Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Companys dividend policy to set forth the Companys current intention to increase its dividend each year. Cash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year quarter. The $0.1 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities reflects higher cash inflows from trade accounts payable, income taxes, and non-current assets and liabilities partially offset by higher cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities, accounts receivables and inventories. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by a non-comparable 2021 bonus payment. Changes in trade accounts payables, income taxes and other non-current assets and liabilities are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments. Net cash used for investing activities was $259 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $402 million for the prior year quarter. This change in net cash used for investing activities includes $231 million in proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $147 million for the prior year quarter. Business, investment and asset acquisitions were $77 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $180 million for the prior year quarter. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 48 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS For the three months ended November 30, 2020, additions to property, plant and equipment were $431 million compared to $387 million in the prior year quarter.

Net cash used for financing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $352 million, compared to $866 million in the prior year period. In the three months ended November 30, 2020 there were $3.3 billion in net debt proceeds primarily from revolving credit facilities described below and commercial paper debt compared to $4.7 billion in net proceeds in the prior year period. For the three months ended November 30, 2020 there were $3.2 billion in payments of debt made primarily for revolving credit facilities and commercial paper debt compared to $4.7 billion for the three months ended November 30, 2019. The Company repurchased shares totaling $110 million to support the needs of its employee stock plans for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $473 million in the prior year quarter which also included stock repurchase program described below. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $4 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020, compared to $14 million during the three months ended November 30, 2019. Cash dividends paid were $405 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020, compared to $410 million for the prior year quarter. The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Companys foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Companys cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Companys cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Item 1A, Risk factors in the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. See Item 3, Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. Stock repurchase program In June 2018, the Company\\\\\\'s Board of Director\\\\\\'s approved a stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company\\\\\\'s common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of November 30, 2020. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending activities under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws. Commercial paper The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. The Company had average daily U.S. commercial paper outstanding of $1.6 billion and $2.9 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 0.63% and 2.55% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The subsidiary\\\\\\'s repayment obligations are guaranteed by the Company. Financing actions On August 29, 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto.

As of November 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement. On November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion credit agreement, consisting of a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $500 million senior unsecured term loan facility, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, on March 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to such credit agreement (such credit agreement as so amended, the November 2018 Credit Agreement) reflecting certain changes to the borrowing notice provisions thereto. On April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the November 2018 Credit Agreement (such credit agreement as so further amended, the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement), which amendment became effective as of May 29, 2020. As of May 29, 2020, the $500 million revolving credit facility portion of the November 2018 Credit Agreement was converted into a term loan facility, such that the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement consists of a $1.0 billion senior unsecured term loan facility. The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) May 29, 2021 and (b) the date of acceleration of all loans under the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement pursuant to its terms. Borrowings under the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, plus an applicable margin of 1.25% in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.125% in the case of alternative base rate loans.

The A&R was also amended to set the final maturity date under the agreement at January 29, 2021. On January 18, 2019, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement (as extended, the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto. The January 2019 364-Day WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 50 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 51 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

On December 23, 2020, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto. The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement includes a (i) a $1.25 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-Day Facility) and (ii) a $2.25 billion senior unsecured 18-month revolving credit facility, with a swing line subfacility commitment amount of $350 million.

Debt covenants Each of the Companys credit facilities described above contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of November 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants. Credit ratings As of January 6, 2021, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were: Rating agency Long-term debt rating Commercial paper rating Outlook Fitch BBB- F3 Negative Moodys Baa2 P-2 Negative Standard & Poors BBB A-2 Negative In assessing the Companys credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Companys business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Companys credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Companys debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. AmerisourceBergen relationship As of November 30, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of November 30, 2020, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements.

See Recent Developments above and Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, the Company does not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity not consolidated by the Company is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. At November 30, 2020, the Company had $17 million of guarantees outstanding and no amounts issued under letters of credit. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in the Company\\\\\\'s outstanding contractual obligations disclosed in the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. See Note 17, New accounting pronouncements, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information.

WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 54 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer compel LIBOR panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis will not be guaranteed after 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR may be discontinued prior to the end of 2021. Certain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market for alternative benchmarks. Such alternative benchmark rate could include the secured overnight financing rate, also known as SOFR, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Information regarding the Company\\\\\\'s transactions are set forth in Note 8, Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On November 30, 2020, the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro, and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions). The Companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of November 30, 2020, by approximately $32 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 5, Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. See --Investment in AmerisourceBergen above. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 55 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Item 4. Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company had completed the creation of a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany with McKesson Corporation. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. The scope of management\\\\\\'s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\\\\\\'s disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff\\\\\\'s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management\\\\\\'s assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management\\\\\\'s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\\\\\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2020. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting In the ordinary course of business, the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls. As a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our controls were not developed and designed to facilitate or accommodate this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter. As we transform our business processes, we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions. These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via third-party outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems. Specifically, the Company is currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This project is a multi-year initiative and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes, as well as the underlying systems environment. These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness. As these changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\\\\\'s internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended November 30, 2020 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 56 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal proceedings The information in response to this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 10, Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of environmental legal proceedings with, or any such legal proceedings known to be contemplated by, a governmental authority if management reasonably believes that the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, above the lesser of $1.0 million or 1% of the Companys current assets. As previously disclosed, the Company has been under investigation by certain counties within the State of California for alleged noncompliance with state hazardous waste regulations. The Company has worked with state and local officials in an effort to resolve this matter. On November 16, 2020, a number of California District Attorneys submitted a complaint and a signed settlement agreement to a California state court in Alameda County ( People of the State of California v. Walgreen Co. , Case No. RG20081172 ) for review and approval. If approved by the court, the settlement, which includes certain injunctive relief, would require the Company to pay penalties and costs and fund supplemental environmental projects in the total amount of $3.5 million. The court approved the settlement. Item 1A. Risk factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in item 1A. \"Risk factors\" in the Walgreens Boots Alliance Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Item 2. Unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the quarter ended November 30, 2020 of equity securities that are registered by the Company pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable law, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements, or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.

Sales for PMT increased 11.2%, sales for Canvys decreased 14.7% and sales for Healthcare increased 28.2%. The increase in PMT was mainly due to growth in various power grid tube product lines, strong growth from our Power and Microwave new technology partners in various applications including 5G infrastructure and increased revenue from our Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication customers buying engineered solutions. The decrease in Canvys was due to temporarily decreased customer demand globally related to COVID-19. The increase in Healthcare was due to a significant increase in demand for the ALTA 750D TM tubes coupled with increased equipment sales in Latin America. During the first six months of fiscal 2021, consolidated net sales increased 1.2% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020. Sales for PMT increased 5.0%, sales for Canvys decreased 11.4% and sales for Healthcare decreased 7.0%. The increase in PMT was mainly due to growth in the power grid tube business, strong growth in bookings and billings from our power conversion and RF and microwave components and continued growth in the Semiconductor Wafer Fab market. The decrease in Canvys was due to continuing struggles in the European market related to the COVID-19 impact on demand for equipment partially offset by strong sales in the North American market. The decrease in Healthcare was due to the impact of the global pandemic as well as ongoing economic issues in Latin America in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit by segment and percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): Gross Profit Three Months Ended November 28, 2020 % of Net Sales November 30, 2019 % of Net Sales PMT $ 11,251 34.2 % $ 9,349 31.6 % Canvys 2,379 35.5 % 2,585 32.9 % Healthcare 713 25.6 % 746 34.3 % Total $ 14,343 33.8 % $ 12,680 32.0 % Six Months Ended November 28, 2020 % of Net Sales November 30, 2019 % of Net Sales PMT $ 21,222 33.6 % $ 19,028 31.6 % Canvys 4,663 34.8 % 4,906 32.4 % Healthcare 817 17.6 % 1,697 34.0 % Total $ 26,702 32.9 % $ 25,631 31.9 % Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs and other provisions. 21 Consolidated gross profit increased to $14.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $12.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Other income/expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 included $0.1 million of foreign exchange losses. Other income/expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 included $0.1 million of investment/interest income offset by $0.2 million of foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency. Other income/expense was expense of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to income of $0.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020. Other income/expense during the first six months of fiscal 2021 included $0.6 million of foreign exchange losses partially offset by less than $0.1 million of investment/interest income. Other income/expense during the first six months of fiscal 2020 included $0.2 million of investment/interest income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision was $0.1 million for both the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The effective income tax rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was a tax provision of 7.1% as compared to a tax provision of (14.8)% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The difference in rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). The 7.1% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax provision of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 and the first six months of fiscal 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2021 was a tax provision of (63.0)% as compared to a tax provision of (123.6)% during the first six months of fiscal 2020. The difference in rate during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). The (63.0)% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Generally, years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011). Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands. We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2018. Net Income (Loss) and Per Share Data Net income during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was $0.7 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and $0.05 per Class B diluted common share as compared to net loss of $0.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 or ($0.05) per diluted common share and ($0.04) per Class B diluted common share.

See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020, filed August 3, 2020 for further information. 23 The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution operations, customers and employees, as well as the U.S. economy in general. However, due to the uncertainty as to when governmental restrictions on business will be fully lifted, the impact thereof, and the duration and widespread nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company cannot currently predict the long-term impact on its operations and financial results. The uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 outbreak include potential adverse effects on the overall economy, the Companys supply chain, transportation services, employees and customers. The COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect the Companys revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response, including expense reductions. Conditions surrounding COVID-19 change rapidly and additional impacts of which the Company is not currently aware may arise. Based on past performance and current expectations, w e believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Cash Flows from Operating Activities The cash provided by (used in) operating activities primarily resulted from net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Operating activities provided $1.1 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2021. We had a net loss of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, $0.5 million for inventory reserve provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $1.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included a decrease of $2.5 million in accounts payable, an increase in inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $3.4 million. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services. The majority of the inventory increase was to support the electron tube and semi-conductor wafer fab equipment business. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the sales increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in accrued liabilities is mainly due to timing of employee compensation and payroll tax payments as well as the timing of other payments. Operating activities used $1.4 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2020. We had a net loss of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, $0.3 million for inventory reserve provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.

The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services. The majority of the inventory increase was to support the continued growth of our electron tube and RF and Power Technologies groups. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The cash flow provided by and used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of investments and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of investments. Cash provided by investing activities of $5.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $16.0 million, partially offset by purchases of investments of $9.0 million and $1.3 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures related primarily to capital used for our Healthcare business and our IT system. Cash used in investing activities of $5.8 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 included purchases of investments of $13.0 million and $0.8 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of investments of $8.0 million. Capital expenditures related primarily to capital used for our IT system and Healthcare and LaFox manufacturing businesses. Our purchases of investments consisted of CDs. Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates. Cash Flows from Financing Activities The cash flow used in financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid. Cash used in financing activities of $1.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from cash used to pay dividends. Cash used in financing activities of $1.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 primarily resulted from cash used to pay dividends. 24 All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities. The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020, filed August 3, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of November 28, 2020. Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 25 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On October 15, 2018, Varex Imaging Corporation (Varex) filed its original Complaint (Case No. 1:18-cv-06911) against Richardson Electronics Ltd. (Richardson) in the Northern District of Illinois, which was subsequently amended on November 27, 2018. Varex alleged counts of infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,456,692 and 6,519,317. Subsequently, on October 24, 2018, Varex filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stop the sale of Richardsons ALTA750 TM product. Richardson filed an opposition to the preliminary injunction. In January 2019, the Court took evidence on the preliminary injunction issue. On September 30, 2019, the Court denied Varexs Motion for Preliminary Injunction. On August 6, 2020, Varex amended its Complaint to add claims of trade secret misappropriation and Richardson moved to dismiss that Amended Complaint on September 9, 2020. Richardson believes the lawsuit to be without merit and a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information at the time the financial statements were issued. ITEM 1A.
