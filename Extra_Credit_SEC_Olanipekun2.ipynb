    "# Extra Credit Opportuinity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can You Predit a 20 Day Change in Stock Price?\n",
    "* Get 5 points added to your lowest Major Lab grade (Lab 1, 2, or 3) for completing the extra credit. \n",
    "* Get 10 additional points, if you achieve a lower Mean Absolute Error < 25% OR a Correct direction > 57.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions \n",
    "1. Create and execute three original 30 day simulation models (Examples below) trying to improve your MAE each time. \n",
    "2. Pickel your predictions for each run using the .gz file extension and the file names shown below. \n",
    "3. Execute the code in the observations section using the predictions from your best run. \n",
    "4. Update with your own observations. Feel free to add any visuals or tables you need to support your observations.\n",
    "5. State how many Extra Credit points you think you should be awarded.  If you qualify for the 10 additional points, explain how / why you think your model achieves a better result. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules\n",
    "* All extra credit work and submissions must be individual.  Do not share your approaches.    \n",
    "* \"Original\" simualtions include you making changes to the models, parameter tuning, feature selection, feature engineering, training record selection strategies etc. to achieve a better result. \n",
    "* Feel free to run more than three simulations, but only include your best 3 simulations in the final submission. \n",
    "* You MUST use the make_cv_folds() function and the train / test folds it creates for the simulation.  DO NOT modify this code in any way.\n",
    "* You MUST use the example code below to execute your simulations.  \n",
    "* Only modify the simuilation code to improve the model predictions.   \n",
    "* You must make a prediction for each of the 30 days and 2,065 test records as shown below.\n",
    "* You must train your model using some or all of the training data for each respective fold (see examples below).\n",
    "* DO NOT mix folds in any way. Use the simulation examples as a starting point. Training records for each fold are 20 days older than the test records you are trying to predict. \n",
    "* DO NOT add new or future training data to the folds!!! \n",
    "* Simulation predictions must be pickled/saved using the filenames: pred_data_e1.gz, pred_data_e2.gz, and pred_data_e3.gz as shown below.\n",
    "* Your work MUST be reproduceable! I will not award any points if I cannot reproduce your work using the cv_folds below!   \n",
    "* You may use any scikit learn tools to create better predictions.\n",
    "* I WILL MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION ON AWARDING EXTRA CREDIT POINTS. PLEASE ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, DO NOT ASSUME.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Things to Consider Trying\n",
    "* Modify TfidfVectorizer() parameters to make better features. \n",
    "* Use different models or model ensembles.\n",
    "* Use sklearn.feature_selection (SelectFromModel, SelectKBest) to select better features.\n",
    "* Try out the AdaBoostRegressor()\n",
    "* Try dimensionality reduction or remove very rare features from the TfidfVectorizer's sparse matrix.  "

MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must-have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. Since fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our own stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens, Women\\\\\\'s and Kids\\\\\\'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Women\\\\\\'s and Kids\\\\\\' businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. As a result of our strategic acceleration, management announced on July 22, 2020, a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our execution. These changes will result in a net reduction of our global workforce and we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $315 million, the majority of which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. These amounts reflect the continued evaluation and variability of our original estimate of employee termination costs and required changes in assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $218 million and expect all remaining actions to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 14  Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. COVID-19 UPDATE The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business results and operations globally, causing us to transform the way we operate in order to better serve our consumers. Although uncertainty due to the pandemic continues to exist, our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 demonstrate our ability to navigate the dynamic situation. Despite physical retail traffic being below prior year levels, Revenues grew 9% and 4% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively, and 7% and 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Through our intentional supply and demand management, inventory levels have declined, and we ended the second quarter of fiscal 2021 with Inventories down 17% compared to May 31, 2020. We reduced discretionary spending while continuing to invest in our digital transformation. As a result, total selling and administrative expense declined 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the first six months of fiscal 2021. However, we expect Demand creation expense to increase in future periods as major sporting events and key sports moments resume following recovery from the pandemic, along with investments in strategic areas to drive growth. Our liquidity position remains strong and we ended the second quarter with $11.8 billion of Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments. Our NIKE Direct business continues to fuel our growth as we navigate through the pandemic, leveraging our digital assets with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 were $4.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, growing 30% and 22%, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Brand digital remained our fastest growing channel, with growth of 80% and 81% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced temporary store closures in geographies affected by rising COVID-19 cases; however, more than 80% of our owned stores were open as of January 4, 2021, with some operating on reduced hours. Despite a substantial majority of stores being open during the quarter, we experienced a 25 Table of Contents decline in comparable store sales in EMEA, North America and APLA, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19. We continue to monitor the ongoing and evolving situation, as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, we expect that fiscal 2021 will continue to be a time of uncertainty across each of our geographies and we expect each market recovery will be dynamic. While our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 are positive, there remains the risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets, revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Company\\\\\\'s jurisdictions. SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 9% to $11.2 billion compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, Revenues increased 7%. Net income was $1,251 million and diluted earnings per common share was $0.78 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to Net income of $1,115 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.70 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes increased 17% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense, partially offset by a decline in gross margin. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 8%, driven by higher revenues across all geographies, footwear and apparel, as well as growth in most key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Revenues for Converse decreased 1% and 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, as double-digit growth in digital and growth in Asia were more than offset by declines in Europe and North America, primarily due to tighter supply and strategic distribution shifts. Our effective tax rate was 14.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and an increase in tax associated with the recent finalization of U.S. tax regulations, partially offset by a more favorable impact from stock-based compensation. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating model. The transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed on December 1, 2020, subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKEs businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor partnership. However, as we remain committed to selling our NIKE Brand businesses in all three countries to third-party distributors, the assets and liabilities of the entities will remain classified as held-for-sale on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information see Note 13  Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company\\\\\\'s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Revenues $ 11,243 $ 10,326 9 % $ 21,837 $ 20,986 4 % Cost of sales 6,396 5,782 11 % 12,249 11,571 6 % Gross profit 4,847 4,544 7 % 9,588 9,415 2 % Gross margin 43.1 % 44.0 % 43.9 % 44.9 % Demand creation expense 729 881 -17 % 1,406 1,899 -26 % Operating overhead expense 2,538 2,443 4 % 4,836 4,753 2 % Total selling and administrative expense 3,267 3,324 -2 % 6,242 6,652 -6 % % of revenues 29.1 % 32.2 % 28.6 % 31.7 % Interest expense (income), net 70 12  135 27  Other (income) expense, net 54 (41)  40 (74)  Income before income taxes 1,456 1,249 17 % 3,171 2,810 13 % Income tax expense 205 134 53 % 402 328 23 % Effective tax rate 14.1 % 10.7 % 12.7 % 11.7 % NET INCOME $ 1,251 $ 1,115 12 % $ 2,769 $ 2,482 12 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.78 $ 0.70 11 % $ 1.73 $ 1.56 11 % 27 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS REVENUES THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES (1) NIKE, Inc.

(2) Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment. (3) Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, due to growth across all NIKE Brand geographies, partially offset by lower revenues in Converse. Higher revenues in Greater China and EMEA each contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with APLA contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 8%, driven by growth in most key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines in Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 4% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher full-price ASP, on a wholesale equivalent basis. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues grew 7%, reflecting higher revenues in several key categories, most notably Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 2 percentage points. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, as well as an unfavorable full-price mix. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 40% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 33% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Digital sales were $2.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, driven by digital sales growth of 80%, which more than offset comparable store sales declines of 4% primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Comparable store sales, which exclude digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating 28 Table of Contents decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 4% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by growth in Greater China and EMEA, partially offset by lower revenues in APLA. Higher revenues in Greater China and EMEA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 7%, driven by growth in several key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 2% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues were flat as growth in Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand, was offset by declines in all other key categories. Unit sales of apparel increased 1%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, as well as unfavorable full-price mix, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 38% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to 33% for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Digital sales were $4.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $2.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 22% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by digital sales growth of 81%, partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales driven by reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . GROSS MARGIN THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Gross Profit $ 4,847 $ 4,544 7 % $ 9,588 $ 9,415 2 % Gross Margin 43.1 % 44.0 % (90) bps 43.9 % 44.9 % (100) bps For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, our consolidated gross margin was 90 and 100 basis points lower than the respective prior year period and reflected unfavorable impacts from COVID-19. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the change in gross margin primarily reflected the following factors:  Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, reflecting higher promotions to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19 (decreasing gross margin approximately 80 basis points);  Lower mix of full-price sales (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points);  Higher other costs, in part reflecting higher warehousing and freight as well as restructuring-related costs related to our organizational realignment, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);  Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points); and  Lower NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, due to favorable product mix, lower air freight and reduced tariffs in North America (increasing gross margin approximately 110 basis points). For the first six months of fiscal 2021, the change in gross margin primarily reflected the following factors:  Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, reflecting higher promotions to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19 (decreasing gross margin approximately 120 basis points);  Lower mix of full-price sales (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points);  Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points);  Higher other costs, in part reflecting higher warehousing and freight as well as restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence and the favorable impact from the release of factory cancellation cost accruals due to higher than anticipated consumer demand (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points); and  Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 110 basis points). 29 Table of Contents TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Demand creation expense (1) $ 729 $ 881 -17 % $ 1,406 $ 1,899 -26 % Operating overhead expense 2,538 2,443 4 % 4,836 4,753 2 % Total selling and administrative expense $ 3,267 $ 3,324 -2 % $ 6,242 $ 6,652 -6 % % of revenues 29.1 % 32.2 % (310) bps 28.6 % 31.7 % (310) bps (1) Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 Demand creation expense decreased 17% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due primarily to lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in sports marketing expense and retail brand presentation costs as a result of COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by an increase in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point. Operating overhead expense increased 4% primarily due to $137 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as continued investments in digital capabilities to support the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy. These costs were slightly offset by disciplined expense management including lower wage-related expenses and lower travel and related costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Demand creation expense decreased 26% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in sports marketing expense and retail brand presentation costs as a result of COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by an increase in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased 2%, primarily due to $184 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as our continued investments in digital capabilities, partially offset by lower travel and related expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Operating overhead expense.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Other (income) expense, net changed from $41 million of other income, net to $54 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to a net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, as well as a charge related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, Other (income) expense, net changed from $74 million of other income, net to $40 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to charges related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as a net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.

We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had favorable impacts of approximately $10 million and unfavorable impacts of approximately $28 million on our Income before income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021, respectively. 30 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2020 2019 % CHANGE 2020 2019 % CHANGE Effective tax rate 14.1 % 10.7 % 340 bps 12.7 % 11.7 % 100 bps Our effective tax rate was 14.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and an increase in tax associated with the recent finalization of U.S. tax regulations, partially offset by a more favorable impact from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate was 12.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to 11.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and the recognition of a reserve in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 related to Altera Corp. v.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\\\\\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. The Company\\\\\\'s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity\\\\\\'s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our differentiated strategic wholesale customers and over the last three years have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated accounts. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers. We expect over the next two fiscal years, we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines over time. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 1%, largely driven by significant growth in digital. NIKE Direct revenues increased 32% as strong digital sales growth of 107% more than offset an 11% decline in comparable store sales primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Footwear revenues increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis, largely driven by significant growth in digital. Unit sales of footwear decreased 4%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs. 33 Table of Contents On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues decreased 3%, as growth in Sportswear was more than offset by lower revenues in several key categories, led by Training, and the divestiture of Hurley in the prior year. Unit sales of apparel were flat while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. The decrease in ASP per unit was primarily driven by lower full-price ASP, in part reflecting higher discounts, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher NIKE Direct ASP. Reported EBIT increased 17% driven by lower selling and administrative expense, gross margin expansion and higher revenues. Gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to lower product costs reflecting the impact of lower air freight and reduced tariffs, as well as lower inventory obsolescence. These impacts were partially offset by lower full-price ASP, reflecting higher discounts to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19 and a lower mix of full-price sales. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense reflected lower advertising and marketing costs, as well as a decline in retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower wage-related expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2021 were flat as growth in Sportswear was offset by declines in nearly all other key categories, led by Training and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 18%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 103%, partially offset by comparable store sales contraction of 25%, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Footwear revenues increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in Sportswear was partially offset by declines in nearly all other key categories, led by Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues decreased 12%, driven by declines in most key categories, led by Training, NIKE Basketball, as well as the divestiture of Hurley in the prior year. Unit sales of apparel declined 10% and lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 2 percentage points. The decrease in ASP per unit was driven by lower full-price ASP and a lower mix of full-price sales, partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher NIKE Direct ASP. Reported EBIT increased 18% driven by lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased approximately 130 basis points due to higher full-price ASP and lower other costs, partially offset by lower margin in our NIKE Direct business and a lower mix of full-price sales. The decrease in other costs was primarily a result of lower inventory obsolescence and the favorable impact from the release of factory cancellation cost accruals due to an increase in consumer demand. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing costs, retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expense, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower wage-related expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services costs.

Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to lower NIKE Direct ASP and a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, as well as lower off-price ASP, which more than offset higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts. Reported EBIT increased 29% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 200 basis points as lower product costs due to favorable product mix were more than offset by unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, and a lower mix of full-price sales. Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business was driven by higher promotions to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19.

Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing expense, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Global Brand Divisions\\\\\\' loss before interest and taxes decreased 2% for the first six months of fiscal 2021 driven by lower total selling and administrative expense. Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing costs. The decrease in operating overhead expense was primarily due lower travel and related expenses as well as lower wage-related costs, partially offset by our continued investment in digital capabilities. 38 CONVERSE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES 2020 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES Revenues by: Footwear $ 416 $ 416 0 % -3 % $ 929 $ 912 2 % 1 % Apparel 32 30 7 % 0 % 54 56 -4 % -6 % Equipment 7 6 17 % 19 % 16 15 7 % 8 % Other (1) 21 28 -25 % -19 % 40 52 -23 % -18 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 476 $ 480 -1 % -4 % $ 1,039 $ 1,035 0 % -1 % Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $ 259 $ 286 -9 % -13 % $ 632 $ 653 -3 % -5 % Sales through Direct to Consumer 196 166 18 % 15 % 367 330 11 % 10 % Other (1) 21 28 -25 % -19 % 40 52 -23 % -18 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 476 $ 480 -1 % -4 % $ 1,039 $ 1,035 0 % -1 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $ 87 $ 90 -3 % $ 255 $ 228 12 % (1) Other revenues consist of territories serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues decreased 4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in revenues was driven by declines in wholesale revenues in North America and Europe as a result of supply chain management and strategic distribution shifts, partially offset by growth in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 15%, as strong digital sales growth across all geographies more than offset declines from Converse owned stores, reflecting the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 11%, while ASP increased 9%, primarily due to growth in digital. Reported EBIT decreased 3%, driven by declines in gross margin, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 230 basis points as higher full-price ASP due to product mix was offset by lower margin in our direct to consumer channel, higher product costs due to product mix, a lower mix of full-price sales, lower revenues in our licensing business and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Lower margin in direct to consumer was driven by higher promotions to reduce excess inventory due to COVID-19. Selling and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower operating overhead, partially offset by increased demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower travel and related expenses. Demand creation expense increased primarily as a result of higher advertising costs. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues decreased 1% for the first six months of fiscal 2021, driven by lower wholesale revenues in North America, as a result of supply chain management and strategic distribution shifts, partially offset by growth in Asia.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 Corporate\\\\\\'s loss before interest and taxes increased $305 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:  an unfavorable change of $276 million in part due to $171 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as a charge related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA;  an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $53 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net; and  a favorable change of $24 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 Corporate\\\\\\'s loss before interest and taxes increased $378 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:  an unfavorable change of $416 million in part due to $218 million of restructuring-related costs associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, as well as charges related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA;  a favorable change of $100 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and  an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $62 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net . For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 13  Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 14  Restructuring, respectively, within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of and for the six months ended November 30, 2020, there have been no material changes to the Company\\\\\\'s hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 4  Fair Value Measurements and Note 9  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. For additional information about our Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices refer to Part II, Item 7. Management\\\\\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:  Product Costs  Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity and factory input costs from the foreign currency adjustments program with certain factories.  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in Other (income) expense, net. 41 Table of Contents TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries\\\\\\' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders\\\\\\' equity. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $184 million and $73 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively, and a detriment of approximately $233 million and $546 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2019, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $63 million and $34 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively, and a detriment of approximately $66 million and $152 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2019, respectively. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2020, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates. MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $10 million and an unfavorable impact of approximately $28 million on our Income before income taxes for the three months and six months ended November 30, 2020, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $3,355 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $1,306 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,283 million of operating cash inflow for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $2,906 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of $72 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to a decrease of $1,600 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. This favorable impact on Cash provided (used) by operations was primarily the result of a $1,929 million decrease in Inventories driven by our intentional supply and demand management, as well as strong digital sales growth. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $2,877 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to $788 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, driven by the net change in short-term investments. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $2,789 million compared to $157 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $292 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $1,868 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, with the decrease from the prior period driven by our election to temporarily suspend share repurchases, resulting in no share repurchases for the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $1,921 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020. 42 Table of Contents As of November 30, 2020, we had repurchased 45.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $4.0 billion (an average price of $89.00 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. To enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. As such, there were no share repurchases made during the quarter ended November 30, 2020. The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022. Our committed credit facilities remain unchanged from the information previously reported on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. As of November 30, 2020 and May 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor\\\\\\'s Corporation and Moody\\\\\\'s Investor Services, respectively. Any changes to these ratings could result in interest rate and facility fee changes. As of November 30, 2020, we were in full compliance of the covenants under our committed credit facilities and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of the covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $4 billion commercial paper program. During the three months ended November 30, 2020, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $112 million. As of November 30, 2020 and May 31, 2020, the Company had $23 million and $248 million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.76% and 1.65%, respectively. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor\\\\\\'s Corporation and Moody\\\\\\'s Investor Services, respectively. To date, in fiscal 2021, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of November 30, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $11.8 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of November 30, 2020, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. Given our existing structure, if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of November 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS There have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. 43 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the Management\\\\\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"the Exchange Act\") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\\\'s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2020. We are continuing several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout these transformation initiatives. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 45 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ANALYST REPORTS Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

    "Yes I can:\n",
    "- A percevied advantage of numbers in words versus digits is that 211,233 is not at all similar to 212,333. But in words, with bi grams applied, some similarities can be captured within the corpus that could be considered in computing the TF-IDF value.\n",
    "- Some numbers are delimited by commas, remove commas and apply the inflect module.\n",
    "- The inflect module still yields commas but these can be removed after the fact to the right words without these added commas.\n",
    "- see below for examples.\n",
    "- Then we can use our word embeddings with n-gram to capture semantic representation of the numbers \n",
    "    - e.g. one thousand is not 'one' and 'thousand' but 'one thousand'.\n",
    "- This worked in most cases but see here for a result:\n",
    "    - 'Gross Profit four thousand eight hundred and fortyseven'\n",
    "    - I think it is still better than the raw numbers. \n",

cares act on march twentyseven two thousand and twenty congress enacted the cares act to provide certain relief because of the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic the cares act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of social security taxes technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property and the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits the company does not believe there will be any material impact to its condensed consolidated financial statements because of the cares act use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates are used to account for certain items such as revenue recognition reimbursable costs and expenses costs of revenue for lot sales sharebased compensation deferred tax asset and liability valuation depreciation and the recoverability of long lived assets actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to covid19 recently issued accounting pronouncements the company continually assesses new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability when it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the companys financial reporting the company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated financial statements and to ensure that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the companys consolidated financial statements properly reflect the change new pronouncements assessed by the company recently are discussed below in june two thousand and sixteen the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards

effective date to january one two thousand and twentythree for smaller reporting companies the company continues to monitor economic implications of the covid19 pandemic however based on current market conditions the company does not expect the adoption of asu two hundred and one thousand six hundred and thirteen to have a material impact on the companys financial statements five index note two revenue recognition and reimbursable costs the company disaggregates revenue by major product line as reported on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income which the company believes best depicts the nature timing and uncertainty of the companys revenue and cash flows the company primarily generates revenues through two lines of business its water and wastewater resource development business and through the sale of finished lots in its land development business both of which are described below water and wastewater resource development segment the companys water and wastewater resource development segment provides municipal water and wastewater services through the rangeview metropolitan district the rangeview district and elbert and highway eightysix metropolitan district the elbert eightysix district to end use customers for fees described below the rangeview district services sky ranch and the other customers on the lowry range the elbert eightysix district services wild pointe monthly water usage and wastewater treatment fees the company provides water to customers collects wastewater from those customers and treats that wastewater which is reused for irrigation purposes for these services the company charges customers monthly fees potable and reuse water fees are comprised of a base charge and a usage charge based on actual amounts of water delivered to the customer using a tiered structure that results in higher fees for higher usage wastewater treatment services incur flat monthly fees the company recognizes these revenues at a point in time upon delivering water to the end use customers water and wastewater tap fees a tap constitutes a right to connect a residential or commercial building or property to the companys water and wastewater systems once granted the customer may make a physical tap into the service lines to connect its property to the companys systems to obtain water andor wastewater service the right stays with the property the company has no obligation to physically connect the property to the lines once connected to the water andor wastewater systems the customer has live service to receive metered water deliveries from the companys system and send wastewater to the company thus the customer has full control of the connection right as it can obtain all the benefits from this right as such tap fees are deemed separate and distinct performance obligations that are recognized as revenue at a point in time land development segment sale of finished lots the company sells lots at its master planned community sky ranch pursuant to distinct agreements with each home builder these agreements follow one of two formats one format is the sale of a finished lot whereby the home builder pays for a readytobuild finished lot and the sales price is paid in a lumpsum upon completion of the finished lot that is permit ready the company recognizes revenues at the point in time of the closing of the sale of a finished lot in which control transfers to the builder as the transaction cycle is complete and the company has no further obligations for the lot the second format is the sale of a finished lot pursuant to a lot development agreement with builders whereby the company receives payments in stages that include i payment upon the delivery of a platted lot which requires the company to deliver deeded title to individual lots ii a second payment upon the completion of certain infrastructure milestones and iii final payment upon the delivery of the finished lot ownership and control of the platted lot passes to the builder once the company closes the sale of the platted lots because the builder takes control and legal ownership of the lot at the first closing and subsequent improvements made by the company improve the builders lot as construction progresses the company accounts for revenue over time with progress measured based upon costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs any revenue in excess of amounts entitled to be billed is reflected on the balance sheet as a contract asset and amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue six index reimbursable public improvement costs the sky ranch community authority board the sky ranch cab is obligated to construct certain public improvements at sky ranch public improvements are items that are not associated with one lot or one home but can be used by the public whether living in sky ranch or not public improvements include items such as roads curbs sidewalks landscaping and parks but also includes items such as water distribution systems sewer collection systems storm water systems and drainage improvements pursuant to agreements between the company and the sky ranch cab see note seven related party transactions the company is obligated to provide funding to the sky ranch cab related to the construction of these public improvements because public improvements are utilized by more than just a single home the costs are typically reimbursed through property tax assessments during the initial development filing at sky ranch the sky ranch cab expended three hundred and sixteen million to build these public improvements including accrued interest project management fees and construction support activities which the company provided the funding for in november two thousand and nineteen the sky ranch cab issued one hundred and thirtytwo million of bonds to recover a portion of the three hundred and sixteen million of public improvements constructed for the initial filing at sky ranch upon the issuance of the bonds the company received one hundred and five million as partial reimbursement for advances the company made to the sky ranch cab to fund the construction of these public improvements the sky ranch cab fully intends to issue additional bonds at some time in the future to recover the remaining two hundred and eleven million of total reimbursable costs not included in the initial bond offering which pursuant to the funding agreement between the company and the sky ranch cab would be payable to the company since the company provided the initial funding even if the sky ranch cab does not issue bonds to repay the remaining two hundred and eleven million the sky ranch cab will receive property tax assessments which could be used to repay the amounts owed to the company for the public improvements this filing represented the companys and the sky ranch cabs first land development activities as such there was no assurance the property taxes or bond issuances would occur in a timely manner or in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of the public improvements because the amount and timing were contingent the company did not estimate or record any potential reimbursements until the cash was received of the one hundred and five million received by the company sixtythree million was recognized as income from reimbursement of construction costs related party in other income and the remaining fortytwo million partially reduced the remaining capitalized costs in land development i nventories the agreements between the company and the sky ranch cab allow for interest to be accrued on amounts funded by the company to the sky ranch cab due to the uncertainty of collecting the interest because this was the companys first development it had no basis to support estimated payments and payment is contingent on tax receipts or the issuance of bonds interest income is not recognized on the amounts owed by the sky ranch cab related to the initial development until it is received these public improvements are constructed pursuant to design standards specified by local governmental jurisdictions including the sky ranch districts the sky ranch cab and arapahoe county and after inspection and acceptance are turned over to the applicable governmental entity to operate and maintain project management services pursuant to two service agreements for project management services the project management agreements with the sky ranch cab the company acts as the project manager and provides the services required to deliver the sky ranch cabeligible public improvements see discussion of reimbursable public improvements above including but not limited to sky ranch cab compliance planning design and approvals project administration contractor agreements and construction management and administration the company is responsible for all expenses it incurs in the performance of the project management agreements and is not entitled to any reimbursement or compensation except as set forth in the project management agreements unless otherwise approved in advance by the sky ranch cab in writing the company receives a project management fee of five percent five of actual construction costs of sky ranch cabeligible public improvements the project management fee to be paid to the company qualifies as a reimbursable cost to the company the project management fee is based only on the actual costs of the improvements thus items such as fees permits review fees consultant or other soft costs and land acquisition or any other costs that are not directly related to the cost of construction of sky ranch cabeligible public improvements are not included in the calculation of the project management fee soft costs and other costs incurred by the company that are not directly related to the construction of sky ranch cabeligible public improvements are included in land development i nventories and accounted for in the same manner as construction support activities as described below per the project management agreements no payment is required by the sky ranch cab with respect to project management fees unless and until the sky ranch cab andor the sky ranch districts have funds or issue municipal bonds in an amount sufficient to reimburse the company for all or a portion of advances provided or expenses incurred for construction of public improvements that qualify as reimbursable expenses because payment is contingent on receipt of tax dollars or the issuance of bonds project management fees are deferred and not recognized until they are received construction support activities the company performs certain construction activities at sky ranch the activities performed include construction and maintenance of the grading erosion and sediment control best management practices and other

permit construct operate and maintain wholesale water and wastewater systems that we own or operate on behalf of governmental entities we also design permit construct operate and maintain retail distribution and collection systems that we own or operate on behalf of our governmental customers additionally we handle administrative functions including meter reading billing and collection of monthly water and wastewater revenues regulatory water quality monitoring sampling testing and reporting requirements to the colorado department of public health and environment sixteen index land development our land development segment is primarily focused on actively developing the sky ranch master planned community located along the i70 corridor to provide residential commercial retail and light industrial lots sky ranch is zoned to include up to three thousand two hundred singlefamily and multifamily homes parks open spaces trails recreational centers schools and over two million square feet of retail commercial and light industrial space just four miles south of denver international airport our land development activities include the design permitting and construction of all the horizontal infrastructure including storm water drainage roads curbs sidewalks parks open space trails and other infrastructure to deliver ready to build finished lots to home builders and commercial customers our land development activities generate revenue from the sale of finished lots as well as construction revenues from activities where we construct infrastructure on behalf of others land development revenues come from our home builder customers under specific agreements for the delivery of finished lots as well as reimbursements for the construction of public improvements such as roads curbs storm water drainage sidewalks parks open space trails etc which come from the local governmental entity the sky ranch cab subject to the approval and issuance of municipal bonds to fund such reimbursements our land development activities provide a strategic complement to our water and wastewater services because a significant component of any master planned community is providing high quality domestic water irrigation water and wastewater to the community having control over land and the water and wastewater services enables us to build infrastructure for potable water and irrigation distribution wastewater and storm water collection roads parks open spaces and other investments efficiently and to manage delivery of these investments to match takedown commitments from our home builder customers without significant excess capacity in any of these investments in june two thousand and seventeen we entered into separate contracts with richmond american homes taylor morrison and kb home pursuant to which we agreed to sell five hundred and six total singlefamily detached residential lots at the sky ranch property we are obligated pursuant to these contracts to construct infrastructure and other public improvements as well as wholesale infrastructure improvements ie a wastewater reclamation facility and wholesale water facilities as of november thirty two thousand and twenty we have incurred three hundred and fortyfive million related to the development of the first filing of sky ranch out of the total estimated three hundred and fiftyeight million we anticipate the remaining thirteen million will be incurred during our fiscal two thousand and twentyone these amounts include estimated reimbursable costs of three hundred and sixteen million for which we received a partial reimbursement of one hundred and five million in november two thousand and nineteen we believe the outstanding two hundred and eleven million of remaining reimbursables from the sky ranch cab will be paid from future municipal bonds as the project continues to grow its assessed value and tax base as of november thirty two thousand and twenty we have recognized three hundred and fiftyfour million of the sales price contracted for with the home builders and the remaining fourteen million is expected to be recognized as revenue in our fiscal two thousand and twentyone in addition from the start of development at sky ranch through november thirty two thousand and twenty the sky ranch development produced ninetynine million of water and wastewater tap fees and we expect that an additional fifty million of tap fees will be received during our remaining fiscal two thousand and twentyone in november two thousand and twenty we entered into separate contracts with kb home meritage homes melody a dr horton company and challenger homes to sell seven hundred and eightynine singlefamily attached and detached residential lots at the sky ranch property this next development phase of sky ranch will incorporate approximately two hundred and fifty acres and is planned to be completed in four subphases due to our strong performance in the first filing of the sky ranch project we were able to realize a thirty increase in our lot price from seventyfive thousand for a fifty lot in phase one to ninetyseven thousand for the same fifty lot in the first subphase of filing two the timing of cash flows will include certain milestone deliveries including but not limited to completion of governmental approvals for final plats installation of wet utility public improvements and final completion of lot deliveries in january two thousand and twentyone we expect to begin construction on the second filing at sky ranch which is expected to include eight hundred and ninetyfive residential lots the one hundred and six lots not currently under contract to home builders are being retained for future use recent developments as the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 continues to escalate we have taken measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers business partners and their families we have staggered the inoffice work hours of various staff to ensure we can maintain proper social distancing we require face coverings in all indoor settings as well as when employees are unable to maintain proper distance while working outside and we have enhanced our cleaning and disinfecting activities we have been able to maintain our level of efficiency with the use of video conferencing and electronic data sharing platforms we were informed that our builder customers also took precautionary measures to ensure the safety of their employees customers business partners and their families these measures varied by builder as a result some of our builder customers reported material net housing order declines during the period compared to the same period a year prior however they are also reporting material increases in orders since the stayathome orders have been reduced we had been expecting to accelerate deliveries of the remaining finished lots at sky ranch into fiscal two thousand and twenty however as a result of the covid19 precautionary measures and stayathome orders we delivered the remaining lots during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty these deliveries were still ahead of the original delivery dates set forth in our contracts with the home builders by nearly two years the most dramatic impact on our operations has been the delay in inspections the permit process and other activities requiring governmental agencies due to expansive work restrictions imposed on their operations we expect covid19 to continue to play a role in potential delays related to the second filing at sky ranch due to rapidly changing governmental orders city and country shutdowns and public health concerns mainly we have experienced delays in the permitting process through the county seventeen index results of operations executive summary the results of our operations for the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty and two

eight hundred and fortyfive five thousand seven hundred and sixtythree four thousand nine hundred and eighteen eightyfive discussion of changes in summary results metered water usage revenues our water service charges include a fixed monthly fee and a fee based on actual amounts of metered water delivered which is based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water we typically negotiate the terms of our rates and charges with our wholesale customers as a component of our service agreements prior to commencement of service our rates and charges for service on the lowry range are based on the average rates and charges of three surrounding water providers water deliveries and water revenues increased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty as compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen primarily as a result of water sales to oil and gas operations water delivery gross margin increased from fiscal year two thousand and twenty as a result of the difference in metered rates for fracking water compared to rates for tap customers as revenues received for fracking water have a higher margin increases and decreases in water deliveries charged at different rates will result in disproportionate increases and decreases in revenues and margins the following tables

wastewater customers are charged based on the estimated amount of wastewater treated wastewater treatment revenues increased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty as compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen the increase was primarily due to increased wastewater treatment revenues from the development at sky ranch the wastewater gross margin decreased compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen due to an increase in staff required to maintain the water reclamation facility at sky ranch development and additional startup costs related to the new facility which went into service in the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty as we add customers to the wastewater system the margins are expected to increase as the system was designed to provide services to more than two thousand connections which has the effect of overburdening the initial revenues with higher per unit costs upfront lot sales revenues lot sales revenues decreased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen primarily as a result of timing of our progress of the first filing at sky ranch to date we have recognized three hundred and fiftyfour million of the estimated total revenue three hundred

revenues relate to richmond home and taylor morrison and will be recognized in our fiscal two thousand and twentyone water and wastewater tap fees tap fees and other revenues decreased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen primarily as a result of timing of tap sales by our homebuilder customers during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty we sold thirtyfive water and wastewater taps at sky ranch and one water tap at wild pointe compared to fiftyeight water and wastewater taps during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen tap sales are driven by home closings and are not contractually established with the builders general and

thousand two hundred and seventysix six thousand two hundred and seventysix one hundred oil and gas royalty income oil and gas royalty income decreased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen primarily as a result of decreased oil and gas production as a result of covid19 and the resulting economic effects caused by stayathome orders and less travel and commuting oil and gas prices decreased significantly and have not rebounded making new production less attractive to oil and gas companies oil and gas lease income oil and gas lease income decreased during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty compared to the three months ended november thirty two thousand and nineteen primarily as a result of the expiration of our lease with bison oil and gas llp interest income interest income represents interest earned on the temporary investment of capital in cash and cash equivalents investments finance charges and interest accrued on the notes receivable from the rangeview district and the sky ranch districts the decrease in the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty compared to two thousand and nineteen was primarily attributable to short term investments held in the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty due to the current low interest rates we are no longer holding any shortterm investments income from reimbursement of construction costs related party in november two thousand and nineteen the sky ranch cab issued one hundred and thirtytwo million of bonds related to the public improvements at sky ranch this is only a portion of the total three hundred and sixteen million which is eligible for reimbursement we anticipate the sky ranch cab will reimburse us for the remaining two hundred and eleven million either by the issuance of bonds for that amount in the future as development continues at sky ranch or from property tax assessments received by the sky ranch cab of the one hundred and thirtytwo million of bonds issued we received one hundred and five million which represents the partial reimbursement of the advances we made to the sky ranch cab for construction of the public improvements pursuant to a funding agreement between us and the sky ranch cab of the one hundred and

statements for additional information factors affecting our results and comparability the company has been and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations these factors include the impact of the coronavirus covid19 covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial results the financial performance of our equity method investees including amerisourcebergen the influence of certain holidays seasonality foreign currency rates changes in vendor payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure strategic transactions and acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic collaborations changes in laws including us tax law changes changes in trade tariffs including trade relations between the us and china and international relations including the uks withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives including under our transformational cost management program as defined below the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season fluctuations in variable costs the impacts of looting natural disasters war terrorism and other catastrophic events and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates these and other factors can affect the companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results estimated covid19 impacts and uncertainties covid19 has severely impacted and is expected to continue to impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world covid19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations further financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 have resulted in among other things temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in us uk and other countries reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of workfromhome policies covid19 continued to affect global economic conditions during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty the company expects this will continue in the second quarter of fiscal two thousand and twentyone including a weaker cough cold and flu season the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers government officials team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as developments in our business as covid19 impacts the economies of the us uk and other countries around the world the company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty we experienced certain adverse impacts of covid19 sales were negatively impacted with the majority of the decline within the retail pharmacy international division this reflected a reduction in footfall in boots uk stores as a second national lockdown was declared in november and social distancing measures remained in place globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and gross margin was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs in the uk the company took measures to keep stores open incurring incremental selling general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning and covid19 drivethru testing sites expenses the company also took certain actions during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty to partly mitigate the impact of covid19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations however operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the three months ended november thirty two thousand and twenty as a result of covid19 in response to covid19 various domestic and foreign federal state and local governmental legislation regulations orders policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid19 the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company it has participated in certain of these programs including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the us and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk and may continue to do so in the future wba q1 fy2021 form 10q thirtyfour walgreens boots alliance inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives such as digital order ahead drivethru with an increased range of products available for drivethru pickup and curbside collection and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the us to continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic the company launched a new covid19 testing program for businesses in fiscal two thousand and twenty since the launch of the program the company has administered more than twentyeight million covid19 tests across the us the company has worked with the federal and state government to help administer covid19 vaccines to residents and staff at more than thirtyfive thousand longterm care facilities in fortynine states the opportunity from the distribution of vaccinations is likely to be partly offset by new covid19 related lockdowns and restrictions and by increased growth investments as a result of covid19 a portion of our global workforce including employees and extended workforce rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in march two thousand and twenty and many continue to work remotely while our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter as further described in item four controls and procedures below the company will continue to monitor and assess the covid19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness the company anticipates additional mandates and directives including revisions thereto from foreign federal state county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid19 pandemic and for some time thereafter the impact of this activity on the us and global economies and consumer customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to covid19 as a result the financial andor operational impact these covid19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact singularly or collectively could be material and adverse we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on our business and geographies including how it is impacting our customers team members suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels however the future impact that covid19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties including the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak governmental business or other actions impacts on our supply chain the effect on customer demand store closures or changes and our operations the health of our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores distribution facilities wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted but is vital to our operations the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and continued disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets and consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown further additional waves of covid19 in fiscal two thousand and twentyone or beyond could cause many of the impacts to the company described herein to return or be exacerbated the circumstances containment and impacts of covid19 remain fluid due to rising incident rates and associated additional lockdowns the companys current expectations described above are forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed below under cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements and in item 1a risk factors in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended august thirtyone two thousand and

qualitative disclosures about market risk item three quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variablerate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variablerate debt which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates such as us treasury rates and commercial paper rates from time to time the company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the fca which regulates the london interbank offered rate or libor has announced that the fca will no longer compel libor panel banks to submit

primarily with respect to the british pound sterling and euro and certain other foreign currencies which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions the company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows these transactions are almost exclusively less than twelve months in maturity in addition the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions the companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates a hypothetical one change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of november thirty two thousand and twenty by approximately thirtytwo million the foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries equity price risk changes in amerisourcebergen common stock price

controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls wba q1 fy2021 form 10q fiftysix walgreens boots alliance inc and subsidiaries

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Item 2. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, accompanying notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other disclosures contained in the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, and in item 1A, risk factors, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Certain amounts in the management\\\\\\'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019 . INTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (sometimes referred to herein as \"divisions\"):  Retail Pharmacy USA;  Retail Pharmacy International; and  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. See Note 14, Segment reporting and Note 15, Sales to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Pharmaceutical Wholesale Transaction On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with AmerisourceBergen. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s Alliance Healthcare business (\"Business\") for approximately $ billion, comprised of $ billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (the \"Transaction\"). Alliance Healthcares investment in China and Italy and its operations in Germany are not part of the Transaction. The Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. The Company will account for the Transaction as a business disposition and report the financial results of the Business as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. In connection with the Transaction, the Company and AmerisounceBergen also agreed to a (i) three-year extension through 2029 of the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution agreement pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S., (ii) a three-year extension of the agreement, that provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH, the Companys global sourcing enterprise, (iii) a distribution agreement pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will supply branded and generic pharmaceutical products to the Companys Boots UK business following the closing of the Transaction and (iv) explore a series of strategic initiatives designed to create incremental growth and efficiencies in sourcing, logistics and distribution. See Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. VillageMD investment Subsequent to November 30, 2020, the Company and VillageMD announced that the Company has accelerated its investment in VillageMD to support the opening of 600 to 700 Village Medical at Walgreens primary care clinics in more than 30 U.S. markets within the next four years, with the intent to build hundreds more thereafter. In July 2020, the Company and VillageMD announced an expansion of their partnership and the intent to open 500 to 700 clinics over a five-year period, supported by the Companys investment in VillageMD over three years of $1.0 billion in equity and convertible debt, which included an initial $250 million equity investment. The Company has now completed the remaining WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 33 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS $750 million investment, which will allow the Company to increase the minimum number of clinics to 600 and expand the rollout at a faster pace. See Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY The Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK\\\\\\'s withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Estimated COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties COVID-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in U.S., UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies. COVID-19 continued to affect global economic conditions during the three months ended November 30, 2020. The Company expects this will continue in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 (including a weaker cough, cold and flu season). The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. As COVID-19 impacts the economies of the U.S., UK and other countries around the world, the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe. During the three months ended November 30, 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19. Sales were negatively impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division. This reflected a reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores as a second national lockdown was declared in November and social distancing measures remained in place. Globally, pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and gross margin was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs in the UK. The Company took measures to keep stores open, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning and COVID-19 drive-thru testing sites expenses. The Company also took certain actions during the three months ended November 30, 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations. However, operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the three months ended November 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. It has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and may continue to do so in the future. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 34 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The Company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital \\\\\\'order ahead\\\\\\' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up and curbside collection, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S. To continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the Company launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses in fiscal 2020. Since the launch of the program, the Company has administered more than 2.8 million COVID-19 tests across the US. The Company has worked with the federal and state government to help administer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and staff at more than 35,000 long-term care facilities in 49 states. The opportunity from the distribution of vaccinations is likely to be partly offset by new COVID-19 related lock-downs and restrictions, and by increased growth investments. As a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter, as further described in Item 4. Controls and procedures below. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness. The Company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact of this activity on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to COVID-19. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. However, the future impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business or other actions; impacts on our supply chain; the effect on customer demand; store closures or changes and our operations. The health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted but is vital to our operations. The impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. Further, additional waves of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond could cause many of the impacts to the Company described herein to return or be exacerbated. The circumstances, containment and impacts of COVID-19 remain fluid due to rising incident rates and associated additional lockdowns. The Companys current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and in Item 1A, Risk factors, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany On November 1, 2020, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany, as part of a strategic alliance. The Company owns a % controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company and reported within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $ million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in the combined business. See Note 2, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. The potential impacts of Brexit As a result of a referendum in June 2016, the UK withdrew from the European Union (Brexit) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services that ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK agreed to a trade deal with no tariffs nor quotas on products, regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition. Since the referendum, there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the UK. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the agreed Brexit trade deal will have on our business, particularly our UK and other European WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 35 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. TRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that is currently expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program). The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Companys information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Companys global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Companys segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including current plans to close approximately 200 Boots stores in the UK and approximately 250 stores in the U.S.. The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will be associated with cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation costs and lease and real estate payments. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows: Transformational Cost Management Program Activities Range of Charges Lease obligations and other real estate costs 1 $350 to 400 million Asset impairments 2 $350 to 400 million Employee severance and business transition costs $850 to 950 million Information technology transformation and other exit costs $250 to 300 million Total cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal costs $1.8 to 2.1 billion Other IT transformation costs $300 to 350 million Total estimated pre-tax costs $2.1 to 2.4 billion 1 Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets. 2 Primarily related to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs. In addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) on September 1, 2019. Since the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to November 30, 2020, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion are recorded as exit and disposal activities. See Note 3, Exit and disposal activities, for additional information. These charges included $264 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $354 million in asset impairments, $471 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $146 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs and $139 million other information technology costs. Costs under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019, were as follows (in millions): WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 36 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

INVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN As of November 30, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 28% of its outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the investment classified within the operating income (loss) of the Companys Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Note 5, Equity method investments to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale operations, among other assets, for $6.275 billion in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2 million shares of common stock of AmerisourceBergen. See Recent Developments above and Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 37 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 38 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net earnings (loss) Net loss attributable to the Company for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $308 million compared to net earnings of $845 million for the prior year period. Diluted net loss per share was $0.36 compared to diluted net earnings $0.95 for the prior year quarter. The decreases in net earnings and diluted earnings per share are primarily due to the charges reflected in the Company\\\\\\'s equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen. Other income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $60 million compared to income of $35 million for the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting equity earnings from other equity investments. Interest was a net expense of $140 million and $166 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was 38.2% compared to 3.6% for the prior year quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was primarily due to the discrete tax effect of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP measure) Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased 13.9% to $1.1 billion, a decrease of 14.3% on a constant currency basis, compared with the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share decreased 11.2% to $1.22, a decrease of 11.6% on a constant currency basis, compared with the prior year quarter. The decreases in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020 primarily reflect COVID-19 impacts across the retail businesses and lower U.S. pharmacy reimbursement, partially offset by cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program, U.S. retail gross margin and U.S. pharmacy procurement savings. The decrease in adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was partially offset by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year quarter.

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 4 Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. Sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 increased 3.9% compared with the prior year quarter to $27.2 billion. Comparable sales increased 3.7% compared with the prior year quarter. Pharmacy sales increased 5.9% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared with the prior year quarter and represented 76.8% of the divisions sales. The increase is primarily due to lower generic utilization and higher volume. In the prior year quarter, pharmacy sales increased 2.9% and represented 75.4% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.0% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to an increase of 2.5% in the prior year quarter. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.4% in the WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 40 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a reduction of 2.5% in the prior year quarter. The effect of generics mix on division sales caused a reduction of 0.3% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.8% for the prior year quarter. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.5% of prescription sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 96.9% in the prior year quarter. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was 204.6 million compared to 213.0 million in the prior year quarter. Prescriptions (including immunizations) filled adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 297.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 294.0 million in the prior year quarter. Retail sales decreased 2.2% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared with the prior year quarter and represented 23.1% of the divisions sales. In the prior year quarter, retail sales decreased 2.2% and comprised 24.6% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales increased 0.4% in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to a decrease of 0.5% in the prior year quarter . The current period was impacted by a weaker cough, cold and flu season and decrease in discretionary categories offset by increase in health and wellness, excluding cough, cold and flu categories. Operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased 6.6% compared with the prior year quarter to $792 million. The decrease was primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and adverse COVID-19 impacts partly offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program and acquisition-related costs related to Rite Aid stores in the prior year quarter results. Gross margin was 20.7% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 21.8% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted in the current period by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 impacts. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 17.8% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 18.5% in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program partially offset by COVID-19 impacts and higher growth investment. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared with the prior year quarter 14.4% to $989 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins which were negatively impacted by increased reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 impacts.

Comparable retail sales in constant currency for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers methods.

Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures. Sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions sales for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year quarter 6.2% to $2.6 billion. Sales were positively impacted in the quarter by 1.9 percentage points ($53 million) as a result of currency translation. Comparable sales in constant currency decreased 3.1%, primarily due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, including COVID-19 impacts. Pharmacy sales increased 0.1% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to the prior year quarter and represented 38.9% of the divisions sales. The positive impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales in the quarter was 1.5 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 3.8% from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher National Health Service (\"NHS\") reimbursement levels in the UK and pharmacy volumes in Mexico. This is partially offset by lower UK prescription volume and reduced demand for pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 42 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Retail sales decreased 9.8% for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to the prior year quarter and represented 61.1% of the divisions sales. The positive impact of currency translation on retail sales in the quarter was 2.2 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 7.6% from the prior year quarter reflecting lower retail sales in Boots UK, including COVID-19 impacts. Operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year quarter 22.7% to $34 million. The decrease reflects increased investment in the Transformational Cost Management Program. Excluding the impact of the increased investment in the Transformational Cost Management Program, the lower footfall is fully mitigated by decisive cost management actions and strong performance of Boots.com. Gross profit decreased 9.0% from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the quarter was positively impacted by 2.3 percentage points ($24 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and higher fulfillment costs partially offset by favorable timing of NHS reimbursement. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8.4% from the prior year quarter. Expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by 2.0 percentage points ($21 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was due to short term cost mitigation and savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 36.0% in the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 36.9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Retail Pharmacy International divisions adjusted operating income for the three months ended November 30, 2020 increased 6.4% to $84 million compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was positively impacted by 5.8 percentage points ($5 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was mainly due to decisive cost management actions and strong performance of Boots.com mitigating the impact of lower footfall.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale This division includes the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale businesses operating in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the British pound sterling, Euro and Turkish lira, and thus the divisions results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 3, Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, for further information on currency risk. On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale operations, among other assets, for $6.275 billion in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2 million shares of common stock of AmerisourceBergen.

Sales were positively impacted in the quarter by 2.3 percentage points ($137 million) as a result of currency translation. Comparable sales in constant currency which exclude the incremental impact of the joint venture, increased 8.3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in emerging markets and COVID-19 related sales in France. Operating income (loss) for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions operating loss for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $1.3 billion, including $1.4 billion loss from the Company\\\\\\'s share of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. This compared with operating income of $122 million in the prior year quarter, including $13 million from the Company\\\\\\'s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Operating loss in the quarter was negatively impacted by 1.8 percentage points ($2 million) as a result of currency translation. The operating loss is primarily due to $1.4 billion related to the Company\\\\\\'s share of equity loss in AmerisourceBergen, partially offset by sales growth. Gross profit increased 8.5% from the prior year quarter. Gross profit in the quarter was positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points ($12 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the currency translation impact, the increase was primarily due to sales growth partially offset by lower gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.6% from the prior year quarter. Expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by 3.5 percentage points ($14 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the currency translation impact, the increase was due to additional costs due to impact of sales growth and from the company\\\\\\'s new joint venture in Germany. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2020 were 6.4% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter.

Adjusted operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by 0.7 percentage points ($2 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to sales growth and a higher contribution of adjusted equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen.

NON-GAAP MEASURES The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the SEC, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company\\\\\\'s management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented. The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020. 2 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and inventory valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangibles assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Companys GAAP financial statements, the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments excludes the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. 3 Transformational Cost Management Program and Store Optimization Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 4 The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (FIFO) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. 5 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger and acquisition related activities. These costs include all charges incurred on certain mergers and acquisition related activities, for example, including costs related to integration efforts for successful merger and acquisition activities. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger and acquisition related activities and do not reflect the Companys current operating performance. 6 Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Companys net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within other income (expense). We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Companys operational performance. 7 Includes significant gain on sale of equity method investment and related adjustments. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 47 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 8 Adjustments to income tax provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. tax law changes, a UK tax rate change and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit). 9 Adjustments to post tax equity earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Companys non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings (loss) from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. 10 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020. 11 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes for the three months ended November 30, 2020. The Company considers certain metrics presented in this report, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Companys management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this report, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of November 30, 2020, compared to $0.8 billion (including $0.3 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of November 30, 2019. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds. The Company\\\\\\'s long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Companys Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Companys dividend policy to set forth the Companys current intention to increase its dividend each year. Cash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2020 was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year quarter. The $0.1 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities reflects higher cash inflows from trade accounts payable, income taxes, and non-current assets and liabilities partially offset by higher cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities, accounts receivables and inventories. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by a non-comparable 2021 bonus payment. Changes in trade accounts payables, income taxes and other non-current assets and liabilities are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments. Net cash used for investing activities was $259 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $402 million for the prior year quarter. This change in net cash used for investing activities includes $231 million in proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $147 million for the prior year quarter. Business, investment and asset acquisitions were $77 million for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $180 million for the prior year quarter. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 48 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS For the three months ended November 30, 2020, additions to property, plant and equipment were $431 million compared to $387 million in the prior year quarter.

In the three months ended November 30, 2020 there were $3.3 billion in net debt proceeds primarily from revolving credit facilities described below and commercial paper debt compared to $4.7 billion in net proceeds in the prior year period. For the three months ended November 30, 2020 there were $3.2 billion in payments of debt made primarily for revolving credit facilities and commercial paper debt compared to $4.7 billion for the three months ended November 30, 2019. The Company repurchased shares totaling $110 million to support the needs of its employee stock plans for the three months ended November 30, 2020 compared to $473 million in the prior year quarter which also included stock repurchase program described below. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $4 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020, compared to $14 million during the three months ended November 30, 2019. Cash dividends paid were $405 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020, compared to $410 million for the prior year quarter. The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Companys foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Companys cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Companys cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Item 1A, Risk factors in the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. See Item 3, Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. Stock repurchase program In June 2018, the Company\\\\\\'s Board of Director\\\\\\'s approved a stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company\\\\\\'s common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of November 30, 2020. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending activities under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT\\\\\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS On January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company\\\\\\'s pharmaceutical wholesale operations, among other assets, for $6.275 billion in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2 million shares of common stock of AmerisourceBergen. See Recent Developments above and Note 19, Subsequent events to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, the Company does not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity not consolidated by the Company is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. At November 30, 2020, the Company had $17 million of guarantees outstanding and no amounts issued under letters of credit. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, in the Company\\\\\\'s outstanding contractual obligations disclosed in the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see the Company\\\\\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. See Note 17, New accounting pronouncements, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS A discussion of new accounting pronouncements is described in Note 17, New accounting pronouncements, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.

WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 54 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer compel LIBOR panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis will not be guaranteed after 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR may be discontinued prior to the end of 2021. Certain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market for alternative benchmarks. Such alternative benchmark rate could include the secured overnight financing rate, also known as SOFR, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Information regarding the Company\\\\\\'s transactions are set forth in Note 8, Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On November 30, 2020, the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro, and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions). The Companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of November 30, 2020, by approximately $32 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 5, Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. See --Investment in AmerisourceBergen above. WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 55 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Item 4. Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company had completed the creation of a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany with McKesson Corporation. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. The scope of management\\\\\\'s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\\\\\\'s disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff\\\\\\'s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management\\\\\\'s assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management\\\\\\'s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\\\\\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2020. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting In the ordinary course of business, the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls. As a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a work from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our controls were not developed and designed to facilitate or accommodate this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter. As we transform our business processes, we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions. These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via third-party outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems. Specifically, the Company is currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This project is a multi-year initiative and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes, as well as the underlying systems environment. These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness. As these changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\\\\\'s internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended November 30, 2020 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls WBA Q1 FY2021 Form 10-Q 56 WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal proceedings The information in response to this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 10, Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of environmental legal proceedings with, or any such legal proceedings known to be contemplated by, a governmental authority if management reasonably believes that the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, above the lesser of $1.0 million or 1% of the Companys current assets. As previously disclosed, the Company has been under investigation by certain counties within the State of California for alleged noncompliance with state hazardous waste regulations. The Company has worked with state and local officials in an effort to resolve this matter. On November 16, 2020, a number of California District Attorneys submitted a complaint and a signed settlement agreement to a California state court in Alameda County ( People of the State of California v. Walgreen Co. , Case No. RG20081172 ) for review and approval. If approved by the court, the settlement, which includes certain injunctive relief, would require the Company to pay penalties and costs and fund supplemental environmental projects in the total amount of $3.5 million. The court approved the settlement. Item 1A. Risk factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in item 1A. \"Risk factors\" in the Walgreens Boots Alliance Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Item 2. Unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the quarter ended November 30, 2020 of equity securities that are registered by the Company pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable law, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements, or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.

Sales for PMT increased 11.2%, sales for Canvys decreased 14.7% and sales for Healthcare increased 28.2%. The increase in PMT was mainly due to growth in various power grid tube product lines, strong growth from our Power and Microwave new technology partners in various applications including 5G infrastructure and increased revenue from our Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication customers buying engineered solutions. The decrease in Canvys was due to temporarily decreased customer demand globally related to COVID-19. The increase in Healthcare was due to a significant increase in demand for the ALTA 750D TM tubes coupled with increased equipment sales in Latin America. During the first six months of fiscal 2021, consolidated net sales increased 1.2% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020. Sales for PMT increased 5.0%, sales for Canvys decreased 11.4% and sales for Healthcare decreased 7.0%. The increase in PMT was mainly due to growth in the power grid tube business, strong growth in bookings and billings from our power conversion and RF and microwave components and continued growth in the Semiconductor Wafer Fab market. The decrease in Canvys was due to continuing struggles in the European market related to the COVID-19 impact on demand for equipment partially offset by strong sales in the North American market. The decrease in Healthcare was due to the impact of the global pandemic as well as ongoing economic issues in Latin America in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit by segment and percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): Gross Profit Three Months Ended November 28, 2020 % of Net Sales November 30, 2019 % of Net Sales PMT $ 11,251 34.2 % $ 9,349 31.6 % Canvys 2,379 35.5 % 2,585 32.9 % Healthcare 713 25.6 % 746 34.3 % Total $ 14,343 33.8 % $ 12,680 32.0 % Six Months Ended November 28, 2020 % of Net Sales November 30, 2019 % of Net Sales PMT $ 21,222 33.6 % $ 19,028 31.6 % Canvys 4,663 34.8 % 4,906 32.4 % Healthcare 817 17.6 % 1,697 34.0 % Total $ 26,702 32.9 % $ 25,631 31.9 % Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs and other provisions. 21 Consolidated gross profit increased to $14.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $12.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.8% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from 32.0% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies in PMT and favorable product mix in both PMT and Canvys, partially offset by under absorbed manufacturing expenses in Healthcare. Consolidated gross profit increased to $26.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared to $25.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.9% during the first six months of fiscal 2021 from 31.9% during the first six months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies in PMT and favorable product mix in both PMT and Canvys as well as foreign currency change impact in Canvys, partially offset by under absorbed manufacturing expenses in Healthcare. Power and Microwave Technologies Group PMT net sales increased 11.2% to $32.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from $29.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to growth in various power grid tube product lines, strong growth from our Power and Microwave new technology partners in various applications including 5G infrastructure and increased revenue from our Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication customers buying engineered solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.2% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to 31.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. PMT net sales increased 5.0% to $63.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 from $60.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to growth in the power grid tube business, strong growth in bookings and billings from our power conversion and RF and microwave components and continued growth in the Semiconductor Wafer Fab market. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.6% during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to 31.6% during the first six months of fiscal 2020 due to favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Canvys Canvys net sales decreased 14.7% to $6.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from $7.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to temporarily decreased customer demand globally related to COVID-19. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 35.5% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from 32.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to favorable product mix. Canvys net sales decreased 11.4% to $13.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 from $15.1 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 primarily due to continuing struggles in the European market related to the COVID-19 impact on demand for equipment partially offset by strong sales in the North American market. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.8% during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to 32.4% during the first six months of fiscal 2020 due to favorable product mix and foreign currency change impact. Healthcare Healthcare net sales increased 28.2% to $2.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from $2.2 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in sales was primarily due to a significant increase in demand for the ALTA 750D TM tubes coupled with increased equipment sales in Latin America. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to 34.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to under absorbed manufacturing expenses. Healthcare net sales decreased 7.0% to $4.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 from $5.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the global pandemic as well as ongoing economic issues in Latin America in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 17.6% during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to 34.0% during the first six months of fiscal 2020 due to under absorbed manufacturing expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $13.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from $13.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher employee compensation and legal expenses, partially offset by lower travel and consulting expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $26.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 from $26.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher employee compensation and legal expenses, partially offset by lower travel and consulting expenses. 22 Other Income/Expense Other income/expense was expense of $0.1 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to expense of $0.1 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Other income/expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 included $0.1 million of foreign exchange losses. Other income/expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 included $0.1 million of investment/interest income offset by $0.2 million of foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency. Other income/expense was expense of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, compared to income of $0.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020. Other income/expense during the first six months of fiscal 2021 included $0.6 million of foreign exchange losses partially offset by less than $0.1 million of investment/interest income. Other income/expense during the first six months of fiscal 2020 included $0.2 million of investment/interest income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision was $0.1 million for both the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The effective income tax rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was a tax provision of 7.1% as compared to a tax provision of (14.8)% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The difference in rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). The 7.1% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax provision of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2021 and the first six months of fiscal 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2021 was a tax provision of (63.0)% as compared to a tax provision of (123.6)% during the first six months of fiscal 2020. The difference in rate during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). The (63.0)% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss) and the movement of the valuation allowance against our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Generally, years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011). Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands. We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2018. Net Income (Loss) and Per Share Data Net income during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was $0.7 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and $0.05 per Class B diluted common share as compared to net loss of $0.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 or ($0.05) per diluted common share and ($0.04) per Class B diluted common share. Net loss during the first six months of fiscal 2021 was $0.5 million or ($0.04) per diluted common share and ($0.03) per Class B diluted common share as compared to net loss of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 or ($0.04) per diluted common share and ($0.03) per Class B diluted common share. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through cash on hand and investments. Cash and cash equivalents were $37.0 million at November 28, 2020. Investments included a CD classified as short-term investment of $9.0 million. Total cash and investments were $46.0 million at November 28, 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and investment at November 28, 2020 consisted of $26.8 million in North America, $9.1 million in Europe, $1.1 million in Latin America and $9.0 million in Asia/Pacific. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $46.5 million at May 30, 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and investments at May 30, 2020, consisted of $30.6 million in North America, $8.3 million in Europe, $0.9 million in Latin America and $6.7 million in Asia/Pacific. We repatriated a total of $8.5 million to the United States in fiscal 2020 from several of our foreign entities. This amount includes $4.4 million from our entities in Germany and the Netherlands in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $1.5 million from our entity in Japan in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and $1.0 million from our entity in Italy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the United States, cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes, withholding or similar taxes. See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020, filed August 3, 2020 for further information. 23 The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution operations, customers and employees, as well as the U.S. economy in general. However, due to the uncertainty as to when governmental restrictions on business will be fully lifted, the impact thereof, and the duration and widespread nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company cannot currently predict the long-term impact on its operations and financial results. The uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 outbreak include potential adverse effects on the overall economy, the Companys supply chain, transportation services, employees and customers. The COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect the Companys revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response, including expense reductions. Conditions surrounding COVID-19 change rapidly and additional impacts of which the Company is not currently aware may arise. Based on past performance and current expectations, w e believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Cash Flows from Operating Activities The cash provided by (used in) operating activities primarily resulted from net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Operating activities provided $1.1 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2021. We had a net loss of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, $0.5 million for inventory reserve provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $1.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included a decrease of $2.5 million in accounts payable, an increase in inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $3.4 million. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services. The majority of the inventory increase was to support the electron tube and semi-conductor wafer fab equipment business. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the sales increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in accrued liabilities is mainly due to timing of employee compensation and payroll tax payments as well as the timing of other payments. Operating activities used $1.4 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2020. We had a net loss of $0.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, $0.3 million for inventory reserve provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $3.3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included an increase in inventory of $3.4 million, a decrease of $1.4 million in accounts payable and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $0.4 million partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.8 million and a decrease of $0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services. The majority of the inventory increase was to support the continued growth of our electron tube and RF and Power Technologies groups. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The cash flow provided by and used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of investments and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of investments. Cash provided by investing activities of $5.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $16.0 million, partially offset by purchases of investments of $9.0 million and $1.3 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures related primarily to capital used for our Healthcare business and our IT system. Cash used in investing activities of $5.8 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 included purchases of investments of $13.0 million and $0.8 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of investments of $8.0 million. Capital expenditures related primarily to capital used for our IT system and Healthcare and LaFox manufacturing businesses. Our purchases of investments consisted of CDs. Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates. Cash Flows from Financing Activities The cash flow used in financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid. Cash used in financing activities of $1.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from cash used to pay dividends. Cash used in financing activities of $1.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 primarily resulted from cash used to pay dividends. 24 All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities. The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020, filed August 3, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of November 28, 2020. Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 25 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On October 15, 2018, Varex Imaging Corporation (Varex) filed its original Complaint (Case No. 1:18-cv-06911) against Richardson Electronics Ltd. (Richardson) in the Northern District of Illinois, which was subsequently amended on November 27, 2018. Varex alleged counts of infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,456,692 and 6,519,317. Subsequently, on October 24, 2018, Varex filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stop the sale of Richardsons ALTA750 TM product. Richardson filed an opposition to the preliminary injunction. In January 2019, the Court took evidence on the preliminary injunction issue. On September 30, 2019, the Court denied Varexs Motion for Preliminary Injunction. On August 6, 2020, Varex amended its Complaint to add claims of trade secret misappropriation and Richardson moved to dismiss that Amended Complaint on September 9, 2020. Richardson believes the lawsuit to be without merit and a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information at the time the financial statements were issued. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020, filed August 3, 2020. ITEM 2.
