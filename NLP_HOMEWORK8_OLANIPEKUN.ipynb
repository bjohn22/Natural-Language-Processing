       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205294/': \"The Suicide Squad is an upgrade in every conceivable way when compared to the 2016 movie. Its also a really fun, gory, colorful and fresh take on the DC universe when compared to the dull, dark and overly edgy garbage of Movies like Batman vs Superman. As well as that, its nice to see a cast of characters that would likely never see the light of day in any other DC movie, Polka Dot man being a prime example. The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205073/': \"The problem with superhero movies. They can easily be po faced and pompous. The audience want fun from their superheroes.Marvel learned this hence why the colourful Thor 3 was such a contrast from Thor 2.James Gunn injected a lot of frivolous fun in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies.Even 20th Century Fox went off the wall with Deadpool. An X Man giving the middle finger to X Men movies.Only Warner Brothers and DC have ploughed on with movies lacking the fun factor.It's James Gunn to the rescue with The Suicide Squad, the follow on to the 2016 original.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Peacemaker (John Cena) and some others including a shark that likes to eat humans become part of Task Force X assembled once again by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis.)Their mission is to infiltrate the island of Corto Maltese which recently had a coup. It also has a facility with something alien inside. To find out more they need to get to the Thinker (Peter Capaldi.)This is a zippy action movie that eschews the traditional three act structure. It plays fast and loose. It's faithful to its comic book origins.It is violent and darkly comic. It also has a lot of heart thanks to Elba and Daniela Melchior who plays Ratcatcher 2.Despite what looks like a scattergun approach Gunn also manages to add some political subtext to the film.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205167/': 'Had a great time watching this movie. One can argue that the characters are less interesting than the first one but James Gunn found a way to make it work. The chemistry between Idris Elba and John Cena is fantastic. The movie is funny and gory as hell. Watch it and have a great time!',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7200780/': \"Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.\",\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7204092/': 'Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008\\'s Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are hiding with the characters, stories, and films, and how to do right, and that\\'s why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruing this beautiful universe that\\'s filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC chose James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you\\'re not familiar with, he directed Marvel\\'s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder\\'s) that when having the right person/people behind a film, he/she will kill it. And THIS IS HOW \"The SUICIDE SQUAD\" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that\\'s all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn\\'t care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It\\'s not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of \"blood\" coming out of the bodies, it was \"flowers\" which made the 3 or 5 min scene very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that\\'s happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don\\'t like Cena\\'s acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how hood his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you\\'d know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can\\'t tell what it is.My rating is 8/10.',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205351/': 'This movie is def one of the top dc movies ever made. It has guardians of the galaxy vibes cause of james gunn ofc (the goat).Peacemaker nailed it.',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205308/': 'Please watch this in theatres. At home on HBO Max will not do this movie justice. James Gunn is a genius and every actor plays their part extremely well and they seemed to have fun with it. My wife and I were laughing a lot during the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the action and R rating. So leave your kids with grandma and go watch it.',\n",

The characters were all great, funny and weird, exactly how the suicide squad should be. I hve no words, it was easily one of the best DC movies I've seen the last few years. More of that DC, give us more of that! I enjoyed every minute of it and I recommend everyone who didn't like the first movie to give this a chance.\",\n",

       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7174916/': 'I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I\\'m VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I\\'m also glad the studio acknowledged that. I\\'m VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn\\'t feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry\\'s this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that\\'s where this movie shines. It\\'s VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*\\nWell written characters / performances\\nComedy/Action (is not repetitive)\\nEffects/CGI\\nStory / plot / script*Cons*\\nThinly written Villain\\nClimax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more \"teamwork\" and not one character being the reason they won (you\\'ll see what I mean)\\nSome Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn\\'t need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are \"impossible to do\" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn\\'t, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an \"The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad\" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.',\n",

It is not a reboot of the previous film-it is a very loose continuation within the same DCEU continuity, meaning you can watch The Suicide Squad (2021) without seeing Suicide Squad (2016) first (or at all).TSS is absurd in all the right ways. It\\'s incredibly funny with tons of amazing action and a story that actually works. No sky beams or dancing enchantresses. Just a bunch of RIDICULOUS comic book characters that were all perfect for this movie. TSS had no business being all this AND having such incredible emotional depth for this genre of film, but it does and it all works!!!For DC fans: This is NOT a Marvel knock-off.

Secondly, for the people complaining about Starro, it\\'s a villain straight from the comics, look and all, a villain I might add that almost took down the entire Justice League. The movies pace is pretty good, John Cena and King shark shine. Bloodsports, just like all the other costumes, are again straight from the comics which is great to see.

There wasn't too much really bad about the movie, but I can admit that it may be too much craziness for some people. There is a lot of gore, so just be aware of that. Don't make the mistake that this movie is for kids because it isn't. It's a very heavy R rating. My main criticism is that not everything was executed perfectly and the movie does slow down a bit in the 2nd act, but the 3rd act definitely makes up for that. King Shark is fantastic!

With the Films\\' R-Rating, It has the ability to go as far as it can get with it\\'s characters that at any moment any character can die in a blink of an eye, and it\\'s not always pretty when that happens. The movie really does utilize the R-Rating pretty well. In my opinion, this is the best Margot Robbie has ever been playing Harley Quinn, She has mastered the role having played it in David Ayer\\'s Suicide Squad and Cathy Yan\\'s Birds of Prey and this gave her the ability to really embrace the character\\'s psyche. She really is the perfect casting as Harley Quinn and I really hope to get to see her play the character for many years to come. Idris Elba\\'s character has a lot of similarities with Will Smith\\'s Deadshot from the 2016 movie at first, but as the movie progresses, they start to feel like two different characters and Idris Elba did a great job playing the role. Peacemaker being played by John Cena combines both the humor and Viciousness of the character as he would do anything to achieve peace even by \"Killing Women and Children\". The story of the movie itself is about gathering a group of misfits and useless villains to create The Task Force X led by Amanda Waller to go on suicide missions to achieve her own goal even if that means sacrificing all of the squad. Viola Davis is brilliant as Amanda Waller, having played the role before in David Ayer\\'s Suicide Squad. But this time she gets the chance to dive deeper into the character\\'s motivations and that she would do almost anything to get what she wants and that made her team question her actions through the course of the movie. The Plot is quite generic, but that\\'s the point. I wasn\\'t going in expecting a complicated plot and twists and turns, there are twists and turns, don\\'t get me wrong but what I\\'m trying to say is that you should go see the movie with the mindset of seeing all these characters come together on a suicide mission to try to save the world from a huge starfish trying to take over the planet. You go in with the mindset of enjoying the movie with all the action and humor in it because it is a lot of fun. The movie also has a lot of heartwarming moments in the backstories of some of the characters, and Ratcatcher 2 gets most of those moments being played by Daniela Melchior, She really did a good job as for me, she can really be the heart of the movie. King Shark being played by Sylvester Stallone is really a fun interpretation of the character as King Shark is always known to be this Human-eating monster with no emotions, But in this movie he is really well written and gets some of those heartwarming moment too. The visual effects are super well done in this movie as I really didn\\'t notice anything that can ruin the experience at all. All of the visuals are of high quality as it was done by studios like Weta Studios as They previously worked on movies like Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League and Avengers: Endgame and much more. The only thing that I would take away from the movie is that I wished they have used Peter Capaldi\\'s The Thinker more. In my opinion, He is very under used in this movie and I hoped that we could experience some of his abilities. Overall this movie is a Joyride, It\\'s a lot of fun to watch and I\\'m excited to see what more can James Gunn bring to the table in the future especially since The Peacemaker mini series is coming out soon on HBO Max.',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7174989/': \"I'm so much lucky that I got to see the movie so early, many many thanks to my you tuber friend John.Now let me come to the movie,,\\nAs I said in the title, the movie was full of life and colour. You can just pause the movie at any time, take a screenshot and it could be a great wallpaper for your PC. I was just looking at the screen and just thinking how the hell did James made this movie, maybe with magic...\\nI didn't get bored for one second. The movie just attaches you with it. But, don't get so attached, 'cause you'll fall in love with the characters and you'll have to see them suffering.Before 30,35 minutes from the ending you could think that, okay, it was a great experience, but now maybe it needs to be end. But just wait a few more minutes, you'll just shock and then you'll never want it to be end. You'll say I want more. The actions were so unique and dramatic. I loved the chemistry between the characters especially Bloodsport and his daughter( and it was far better than deadshot & his daughter's story from the first movie). And King Shark, oh my goodness, he was just great, he was just bringing life to the movie with his every appearances. You can just see that the actors worked so hard for their rolls.It wasn't like a DC movie or any kinda movie attached to a superhero universe. It can stand by it's own. It was a totally different experience, a much much better experience than other DC movies. I hope it joins the Billion dollars club 'cause it's worth it. I am sure you'll never get bored by this movie doesn't matter how many times you watch it.At last, l can say to james gunn that he just changed DC by this movie. Thank you very much.\",\n",

       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7154265/': 'First there were snakes on a plane, then there were zombies on a plane, and now there are vampires on a flight. Doesn\\'t they screen what passes through the gates at all?I sat down to watch the 2021 movie \"Blood Red Sky\" as I stumbled upon it on Netflix, and I must admit that it sounded interesting and the movie\\'s cover/poster definitely helped win me over.And I will say that writers Stefan Holtz and Peter Thorwarth definitely managed to write an entertaining enough story.While it started out fairly slow, it was a great setup, because the writers were excellent at setting the scene and carving out the characters, getting the audience to know the characters and have a connection with them. And then slow, feeding the audience tiny bits of what was going on and going to happen. So there wasn\\'t a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.The movie definitely has a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the various roles and characters in the movie. I am not familiar with actress Peri Baumeister, but she really performed quite well in this movie. Now, I am not a fan of actor Dominic Purcell in any way, but he seemed rather out of place in this movie, especially in comparison to all other actors around him. And I feel it was a shame that actor Graham McTavish wasn\\'t given a larger role to play, because he could definitely had added a lot more to the movie.Visually then \"Blood Red Sky\" is quite impressive. I especially liked the design of the vampires, and how they became more and more bestial as they lost more and more touch with their humanity. That was just phenomenal. And the special effects team definitely worked their craft well here.\"Blood Red Sky\" turned out to be rather entertaining. And I am rating it a six out of ten stars. If you enjoy action-packed vampire movies, then you should give \"Blood Red Sky\" a chance.',\n",
       " 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7184019/': \"Where do I begin with this movie....it had a lot of potential. I liked the direction it was going with the mother trying to keep her humanity and protect her son / the passengers on the plane while ensuring that the vampirism did not spread. But the characters just kept making stupid decisions after stupid decisions that went against any common sense just to suit the direction that the movie writers wanted the story to go to the point that it became painful to watch.Firing a gun on a plane...lighting a fire in a car on a plane... shooting a hole in a window on a plane,(granted it was an accident but then it just magically stopped being a problem after losing cabin pressure), purposely shooting yourself up with vampire blood, asking evil vampires to bite you because you're a greedy rich person who doesn't want to die.Also the random passenger who towards the end of the movie stands up and says he was in the army\\nand knows how to help the group defend themselves yet was absolutely no where to be seen when the terrorists first took over. And the angry husband who's wife is trampled to death so he grabs the gun off the army expert so he can exact revenge, what kind of soldier let's that happen.Also what sane woman with a baby in her arms would enter a house and follow a massive blood trail down to a basement? Just very lazy story writing to point the story in the direction that the writers wanted it to go without incorporating any common sense, you literally have to watch this movie with your brain completely switched off.On top of this, it was also ruined with just the stereotypical predictable characters, the rich guy who doesn't care about anyone else who you can predict will screw other people over to save himself and the psycho idiot who will be drawn to power and who you know will want to become a vampire. And the son... the movie might have been more enjoyable if he had spoken and done way less. Ignoring the fact that he was able to use a gun when it was probably the first time he had ever picked one up, I couldn't forgive the fact that he hesitates to shoot a terrorist who is about to kill his mother, despite her being a vampire which would make you assume that the son is mentally a lot tougher for his age having seen some messed up things because of her.Finally, how can you handcuff someone who's missing a hand...\\nThe mother and her story was actually a very interesting take on vampires that I had never seen before, but all of the above ruined the story for me, I'd never watch it again. Dominic Purcell was also wasted in this movie too, I'd have liked to have seen him with a more significant role.\",\n",

The film was already too predictable without showing the audience how it ends.Blood Red Sky needed a good film editor. Because it's a horror action movie cutting twenty minutes or so of superfluous scenes might have sped up the ride and made the movie better. I get it the protagonist is a vampire and loves her son. The first act was reasonably good, the second act felt way too long and predictable, and the third act ended with your typical action trope.It gets four stars because most of the effects were good, the acting was, for the most part, competent, and I watched the whole thing.\",\n",

What a relief-something fresh! Congrats to the writer/producer/director and crew!Let me level with you. No, it's not perfect. I won't even get into that because its flaws are relatively minor. But this movie is pretty darn close to perfect for what it is. Even compared against non-vampire movies, this is STILL a wonderful and entertaining movie to spend a couple hours watching. That's the key: entertaining. This is pure entertainment, not some lofty, intellectual creation.If you can handle (fake) gore, like a thrill with some scary scenes, I think you will enjoy this movie.\",\n",

It's Hijackers vs Vampires vs Passengers vs The Kid, except it only sounds good, but the execution? Oh man, it's just awful. It's definitely an opportunity missed and I was wondering if someone else could just take this project and do it right. Trust me, this movie starts out well, but just goes haywire once the mother twist is revealed. The mother vampire goes all out to protect her sun from the hijackers except its the son who turns out to be the biggest illogical twist of them all. He's practically a human superhero who ends up saving everyone. The bravest and the smartest of 'em all turns out to be kid putting everyone else to shame. Somehow he always ends up doing the right thing at the right time and it just gets irritating. I couldn't understand the physics behind some of the actions. The airlock is open and the enemy is pulled out due to the air pressure, but the kid and his mom aren't. Wow. The vampire mother is walking around passengers bleeding, but she doesn't crave for their blood. This was one of the most flawed representations of a vampire. Although, the concept is good, but they could have easily pulled it off creatively. Poor script, poor screenplay and pathetic climax. The kid ends up ruining the entire experience. I wouldn't be surprised, if he grows up to be Blade because he's already half superhero.\",\n",

And what the heck is wrong with her movements? She gets stuck behind the seats....gets her leg stuck in the arm rest slot....yet can still retain her human mind and speaks perfectly fine...I don't get it.\",\n",

You see an airplane is coming into a Scottish airfield, and there are no rescue vehicles there, just two police/military vehicles. And you see a little boy getting out of the aircraft.Then the story begins.It has the tensions before going on a flight, a little boy checking in both him and his mother. And the mother clearly has some medical issues,\\nAnd that is why they are on this flight, to go NY to see a doctor who can cure her.The flight goes along, then the hijacking begins. That was the best. You really hate the character Eightball. He's completely nuts. And when the other hijackers wants to kill him, that's even better because I wanted to kill him as well.However, in the end of the movie, there are too many vampires. I got lost when the mother bit one and he bit another.. and so on. Too many vampires is what's stopping me from going higher in the rating. It goes completely nuts.But it has a good ending, even though you wanted the mother to survive and get to the waiting doctor.Superb acting, especially from Carl Anton Koch, who played Elias.I was giving this a 7 at first, but I raise it to 8 just for the ending.Great movie, Netflix does it again. And I would certainly watch this again.\",\n",

       " \"The Suicide Squad is an upgrade in every conceivable way when compared to the 2016 movie. Its also a really fun, gory, colorful and fresh take on the DC universe when compared to the dull, dark and overly edgy garbage of Movies like Batman vs Superman. As well as that, its nice to see a cast of characters that would likely never see the light of day in any other DC movie, Polka Dot man being a prime example. The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience.\",\n",
       " \"The problem with superhero movies. They can easily be po faced and pompous. The audience want fun from their superheroes.Marvel learned this hence why the colourful Thor 3 was such a contrast from Thor 2.James Gunn injected a lot of frivolous fun in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies.Even 20th Century Fox went off the wall with Deadpool. An X Man giving the middle finger to X Men movies.Only Warner Brothers and DC have ploughed on with movies lacking the fun factor.It's James Gunn to the rescue with The Suicide Squad, the follow on to the 2016 original.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Peacemaker (John Cena) and some others including a shark that likes to eat humans become part of Task Force X assembled once again by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis.)Their mission is to infiltrate the island of Corto Maltese which recently had a coup. It also has a facility with something alien inside. To find out more they need to get to the Thinker (Peter Capaldi.)This is a zippy action movie that eschews the traditional three act structure. It plays fast and loose. It's faithful to its comic book origins.It is violent and darkly comic. It also has a lot of heart thanks to Elba and Daniela Melchior who plays Ratcatcher 2.Despite what looks like a scattergun approach Gunn also manages to add some political subtext to the film.\",\n",
       " 'Had a great time watching this movie. One can argue that the characters are less interesting than the first one but James Gunn found a way to make it work. The chemistry between Idris Elba and John Cena is fantastic. The movie is funny and gory as hell. Watch it and have a great time!',\n",
       " \"Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.\",\n",
       " 'Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008\\'s Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are hiding with the characters, stories, and films, and how to do right, and that\\'s why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruing this beautiful universe that\\'s filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC chose James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you\\'re not familiar with, he directed Marvel\\'s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder\\'s) that when having the right person/people behind a film, he/she will kill it. And THIS IS HOW \"The SUICIDE SQUAD\" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that\\'s all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn\\'t care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It\\'s not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of \"blood\" coming out of the bodies, it was \"flowers\" which made the 3 or 5 min scene very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that\\'s happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don\\'t like Cena\\'s acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how hood his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you\\'d know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can\\'t tell what it is.My rating is 8/10.',\n",
       " 'This movie is def one of the top dc movies ever made. It has guardians of the galaxy vibes cause of james gunn ofc (the goat).Peacemaker nailed it.',\n",
       " 'Please watch this in theatres. At home on HBO Max will not do this movie justice. James Gunn is a genius and every actor plays their part extremely well and they seemed to have fun with it. My wife and I were laughing a lot during the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the action and R rating. So leave your kids with grandma and go watch it.',\n",
       " \"The moment I saw James Gunn's name I knew it would be a good movie! He made the Guardians famous and saved the suicide squad. The characters were all great, funny and weird, exactly how the suicide squad should be. I hve no words, it was easily one of the best DC movies I've seen the last few years. More of that DC, give us more of that! I enjoyed every minute of it and I recommend everyone who didn't like the first movie to give this a chance.\",\n",

       " 'I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I\\'m VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I\\'m also glad the studio acknowledged that. I\\'m VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn\\'t feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry\\'s this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that\\'s where this movie shines. It\\'s VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*\\nWell written characters / performances\\nComedy/Action (is not repetitive)\\nEffects/CGI\\nStory / plot / script*Cons*\\nThinly written Villain\\nClimax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more \"teamwork\" and not one character being the reason they won (you\\'ll see what I mean)\\nSome Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn\\'t need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are \"impossible to do\" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn\\'t, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an \"The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad\" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.',\n",

       " 'James Gunn\\'s The Suicide Squad is SO much better than the first Suicide Squad. It is not a reboot of the previous film-it is a very loose continuation within the same DCEU continuity, meaning you can watch The Suicide Squad (2021) without seeing Suicide Squad (2016) first (or at all).TSS is absurd in all the right ways. It\\'s incredibly funny with tons of amazing action and a story that actually works. No sky beams or dancing enchantresses. Just a bunch of RIDICULOUS comic book characters that were all perfect for this movie. TSS had no business being all this AND having such incredible emotional depth for this genre of film, but it does and it all works!!!For DC fans: This is NOT a Marvel knock-off. It is very much a DC Comics movie with its own style.Maturity: This film is Rated R for lots of gore and foul language, plus 2 very brief shots of nudity (not involved any \"the act\").',\n",
       " 'Violet, bloody and hilarious. Margot Robbie really gets to shine as Harley. Highly recommended. James Gun made the movie we all wanted to see. Hallowed be his name.',\n",

That should tell you everything ya need to know about some of these movie \"reviewers\".Now about this movie. 1000% better than than the first, not meant to be a Harley Quinn movie, as people were upset she wasn\\'t place on a pedestal for this film, no, read the comics, she was almost never the main character in the Suicide Squad. Secondly, for the people complaining about Starro, it\\'s a villain straight from the comics, look and all, a villain I might add that almost took down the entire Justice League. The movies pace is pretty good, John Cena and King shark shine. Bloodsports, just like all the other costumes, are again straight from the comics which is great to see. All and all the movie is strong and people here need to hop of their high horses, especiallyyyyyy, if you\\'re a fan of legends of tomorrow-terrible cringe show.Go see this.',\n",
       " \"As a fan of DC comics and James Gunn, I was pretty pumped and excited for this film! I can definitely say.... It doesn't disappoint. Almost every second of this was just fun and emotional. I actually cared about the characters and I finally like Harley Quinn. There wasn't too much really bad about the movie, but I can admit that it may be too much craziness for some people. There is a lot of gore, so just be aware of that. Don't make the mistake that this movie is for kids because it isn't. It's a very heavy R rating. My main criticism is that not everything was executed perfectly and the movie does slow down a bit in the 2nd act, but the 3rd act definitely makes up for that. King Shark is fantastic! Go watch it already!\",\n",
       " \"This is a comic book in a movie format. Cheesy, hokey, predictable etc. But it's a fun, action packed escape from reality. With a good soundtrack. John Cena is good for a change too.In a time when Marvel movies have gone woke, this film is 'Unisex'.\",\n",

It was so hilarious. For me, I think it\\'s the best DC movie I watched so far even I still haven\\'t watched \"Justice League: Zack Snyder\" yet. Also the performances, Margot Ribbie and Adres Alba were so great. John Cena was unexpectedly awesome in this movie. As an overall, I loved this movie and I think it became one of my favorite James Gun movies of all time.',\n",
       " 'Let\\'s start by saying that The Suicide Squad has a little bit of everything. It has Humor, Action, Gore, Drama and you can feel that though-out the movie. This is easily James Gunn\\'s best movie to date, he was given complete freedom to do what he wants with this huge ensemble of characters, and boy, he didn\\'t disappoint. The movie is starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport and John Cena as Peacemaker. With the Films\\' R-Rating, It has the ability to go as far as it can get with it\\'s characters that at any moment any character can die in a blink of an eye, and it\\'s not always pretty when that happens. The movie really does utilize the R-Rating pretty well. In my opinion, this is the best Margot Robbie has ever been playing Harley Quinn, She has mastered the role having played it in David Ayer\\'s Suicide Squad and Cathy Yan\\'s Birds of Prey and this gave her the ability to really embrace the character\\'s psyche. She really is the perfect casting as Harley Quinn and I really hope to get to see her play the character for many years to come. Idris Elba\\'s character has a lot of similarities with Will Smith\\'s Deadshot from the 2016 movie at first, but as the movie progresses, they start to feel like two different characters and Idris Elba did a great job playing the role. Peacemaker being played by John Cena combines both the humor and Viciousness of the character as he would do anything to achieve peace even by \"Killing Women and Children\". The story of the movie itself is about gathering a group of misfits and useless villains to create The Task Force X led by Amanda Waller to go on suicide missions to achieve her own goal even if that means sacrificing all of the squad. Viola Davis is brilliant as Amanda Waller, having played the role before in David Ayer\\'s Suicide Squad. But this time she gets the chance to dive deeper into the character\\'s motivations and that she would do almost anything to get what she wants and that made her team question her actions through the course of the movie. The Plot is quite generic, but that\\'s the point. I wasn\\'t going in expecting a complicated plot and twists and turns, there are twists and turns, don\\'t get me wrong but what I\\'m trying to say is that you should go see the movie with the mindset of seeing all these characters come together on a suicide mission to try to save the world from a huge starfish trying to take over the planet. You go in with the mindset of enjoying the movie with all the action and humor in it because it is a lot of fun. The movie also has a lot of heartwarming moments in the backstories of some of the characters, and Ratcatcher 2 gets most of those moments being played by Daniela Melchior, She really did a good job as for me, she can really be the heart of the movie. King Shark being played by Sylvester Stallone is really a fun interpretation of the character as King Shark is always known to be this Human-eating monster with no emotions, But in this movie he is really well written and gets some of those heartwarming moment too. The visual effects are super well done in this movie as I really didn\\'t notice anything that can ruin the experience at all. All of the visuals are of high quality as it was done by studios like Weta Studios as They previously worked on movies like Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League and Avengers: Endgame and much more. The only thing that I would take away from the movie is that I wished they have used Peter Capaldi\\'s The Thinker more. In my opinion, He is very under used in this movie and I hoped that we could experience some of his abilities. Overall this movie is a Joyride, It\\'s a lot of fun to watch and I\\'m excited to see what more can James Gunn bring to the table in the future especially since The Peacemaker mini series is coming out soon on HBO Max.',\n",
       " \"I'm so much lucky that I got to see the movie so early, many many thanks to my you tuber friend John.Now let me come to the movie,,\\nAs I said in the title, the movie was full of life and colour. You can just pause the movie at any time, take a screenshot and it could be a great wallpaper for your PC. I was just looking at the screen and just thinking how the hell did James made this movie, maybe with magic...\\nI didn't get bored for one second. The movie just attaches you with it. But, don't get so attached, 'cause you'll fall in love with the characters and you'll have to see them suffering.Before 30,35 minutes from the ending you could think that, okay, it was a great experience, but now maybe it needs to be end. But just wait a few more minutes, you'll just shock and then you'll never want it to be end. You'll say I want more. The actions were so unique and dramatic. I loved the chemistry between the characters especially Bloodsport and his daughter( and it was far better than deadshot & his daughter's story from the first movie). And King Shark, oh my goodness, he was just great, he was just bringing life to the movie with his every appearances. You can just see that the actors worked so hard for their rolls.It wasn't like a DC movie or any kinda movie attached to a superhero universe. It can stand by it's own. It was a totally different experience, a much much better experience than other DC movies. I hope it joins the Billion dollars club 'cause it's worth it. I am sure you'll never get bored by this movie doesn't matter how many times you watch it.At last, l can say to james gunn that he just changed DC by this movie. Thank you very much.\",\n",

Doesn\\'t they screen what passes through the gates at all?I sat down to watch the 2021 movie \"Blood Red Sky\" as I stumbled upon it on Netflix, and I must admit that it sounded interesting and the movie\\'s cover/poster definitely helped win me over.And I will say that writers Stefan Holtz and Peter Thorwarth definitely managed to write an entertaining enough story.While it started out fairly slow, it was a great setup, because the writers were excellent at setting the scene and carving out the characters, getting the audience to know the characters and have a connection with them. And then slow, feeding the audience tiny bits of what was going on and going to happen. So there wasn\\'t a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.The movie definitely has a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the various roles and characters in the movie. I am not familiar with actress Peri Baumeister, but she really performed quite well in this movie. Now, I am not a fan of actor Dominic Purcell in any way, but he seemed rather out of place in this movie, especially in comparison to all other actors around him. And I feel it was a shame that actor Graham McTavish wasn\\'t given a larger role to play, because he could definitely had added a lot more to the movie.Visually then \"Blood Red Sky\" is quite impressive. I especially liked the design of the vampires, and how they became more and more bestial as they lost more and more touch with their humanity. That was just phenomenal. And the special effects team definitely worked their craft well here.\"Blood Red Sky\" turned out to be rather entertaining. And I am rating it a six out of ten stars. If you enjoy action-packed vampire movies, then you should give \"Blood Red Sky\" a chance.',\n",
       " \"Where do I begin with this movie....it had a lot of potential. I liked the direction it was going with the mother trying to keep her humanity and protect her son / the passengers on the plane while ensuring that the vampirism did not spread. But the characters just kept making stupid decisions after stupid decisions that went against any common sense just to suit the direction that the movie writers wanted the story to go to the point that it became painful to watch.Firing a gun on a plane...lighting a fire in a car on a plane... shooting a hole in a window on a plane,(granted it was an accident but then it just magically stopped being a problem after losing cabin pressure), purposely shooting yourself up with vampire blood, asking evil vampires to bite you because you're a greedy rich person who doesn't want to die.Also the random passenger who towards the end of the movie stands up and says he was in the army\\nand knows how to help the group defend themselves yet was absolutely no where to be seen when the terrorists first took over. And the angry husband who's wife is trampled to death so he grabs the gun off the army expert so he can exact revenge, what kind of soldier let's that happen.Also what sane woman with a baby in her arms would enter a house and follow a massive blood trail down to a basement? Just very lazy story writing to point the story in the direction that the writers wanted it to go without incorporating any common sense, you literally have to watch this movie with your brain completely switched off.On top of this, it was also ruined with just the stereotypical predictable characters, the rich guy who doesn't care about anyone else who you can predict will screw other people over to save himself and the psycho idiot who will be drawn to power and who you know will want to become a vampire. And the son... the movie might have been more enjoyable if he had spoken and done way less. Ignoring the fact that he was able to use a gun when it was probably the first time he had ever picked one up, I couldn't forgive the fact that he hesitates to shoot a terrorist who is about to kill his mother, despite her being a vampire which would make you assume that the son is mentally a lot tougher for his age having seen some messed up things because of her.Finally, how can you handcuff someone who's missing a hand...\\nThe mother and her story was actually a very interesting take on vampires that I had never seen before, but all of the above ruined the story for me, I'd never watch it again. Dominic Purcell was also wasted in this movie too, I'd have liked to have seen him with a more significant role.\",\n",

The film was already too predictable without showing the audience how it ends.Blood Red Sky needed a good film editor. Because it's a horror action movie cutting twenty minutes or so of superfluous scenes might have sped up the ride and made the movie better. I get it the protagonist is a vampire and loves her son. The first act was reasonably good, the second act felt way too long and predictable, and the third act ended with your typical action trope.It gets four stars because most of the effects were good, the acting was, for the most part, competent, and I watched the whole thing.\",\n",

What a relief-something fresh! Congrats to the writer/producer/director and crew!Let me level with you. No, it's not perfect. I won't even get into that because its flaws are relatively minor. But this movie is pretty darn close to perfect for what it is. Even compared against non-vampire movies, this is STILL a wonderful and entertaining movie to spend a couple hours watching.

The mother vampire goes all out to protect her sun from the hijackers except its the son who turns out to be the biggest illogical twist of them all. He's practically a human superhero who ends up saving everyone. The bravest and the smartest of 'em all turns out to be kid putting everyone else to shame. Somehow he always ends up doing the right thing at the right time and it just gets irritating. I couldn't understand the physics behind some of the actions. The airlock is open and the enemy is pulled out due to the air pressure, but the kid and his mom aren't. Wow. The vampire mother is walking around passengers bleeding, but she doesn't crave for their blood. This was one of the most flawed representations of a vampire. Although, the concept is good, but they could have easily pulled it off creatively. Poor script, poor screenplay and pathetic climax. The kid ends up ruining the entire experience. I wouldn't be surprised, if he grows up to be Blade because he's already half superhero.\",\n",
       " \"Way to use a dumb kid to force the plot...literally this story makes no sense. And also the worse vampire in history who can easily overpowers the buff bald dude and kills him, yet she cannot climb up the floor opening swiftly and gets shot in the leg? And what the heck is wrong with her movements? She gets stuck behind the seats....gets her leg stuck in the arm rest slot....yet can still retain her human mind and speaks perfectly fine...I don't get it.\",\n",
       " \"I actually liked this movie.The start is pretty okay. You see an airplane is coming into a Scottish airfield, and there are no rescue vehicles there, just two police/military vehicles. And you see a little boy getting out of the aircraft.Then the story begins.It has the tensions before going on a flight, a little boy checking in both him and his mother. And the mother clearly has some medical issues,\\nAnd that is why they are on this flight, to go NY to see a doctor who can cure her.The flight goes along, then the hijacking begins. That was the best. You really hate the character Eightball. He's completely nuts. And when the other hijackers wants to kill him, that's even better because I wanted to kill him as well.However, in the end of the movie, there are too many vampires. I got lost when the mother bit one and he bit another.. and so on. Too many vampires is what's stopping me from going higher in the rating. It goes completely nuts.But it has a good ending, even though you wanted the mother to survive and get to the waiting doctor.Superb acting, especially from Carl Anton Koch, who played Elias.I was giving this a 7 at first, but I raise it to 8 just for the ending.Great movie, Netflix does it again. And I would certainly watch this again.\",\n",
